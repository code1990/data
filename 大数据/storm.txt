Words can inspire us, provoke us to rage, bring us close to one another, make us happy, and make us sad. It takes us from one emotion to the next covering every spectrum of the human existence and experience. It is an expression of art and emotion through spoken and written words. It is the stories from the mouths of griots that traveled the middle passage carrying our history in their belly. It is the song of the field slave that began as a prayer in a whisper of freedom, and ended as a tribute to the past in the mouths of children during black history month. It is the hook of your favorite song that started as a line in the mind of an artist that he could not shake. It is the flawless movements of a dancer that started as the awkward pirouettes of a little girl in her ballet class mirror. It is the first dance of a bride and groom that started as a mutual glance of two strangers across a crowded room. It is the birth of a child that started as hope in the hearts of her parents.

R. Martin's epic high fantasy series. In A Game of Thrones, an ancient kingdom was torn by the ambitions of ruthless men and women; in A Clash of Kings, war, sorcery, and madness swept over the kingdom like a voracious beast of prey. Now, as the brutal struggle for power nears its tumultuous climax, the battered and divided kingdom faces its most terrifying invasion--one that is being spearheaded from beyond the grave....\nA Storm Of Swords\nOf the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King's Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. Filled with the stench of death and decay from the destructive dynastic war, Daenerys is gathering allies and strength for an assault on King's Landing, hoping to win back the crown she believes is rightfully hers. But as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings bent on overwhelming the Seven Kingdoms arrives from the outermost lineof civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others--a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. And as the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest in the quest for victory until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords....Brilliantly conceived and grand in scope, A Storm of Swords is the incredible tale of a world of harsh beauty and powerful magic, torn by treachery, ravaged by brutality, and consumed by greed and ambition. It portrays a war-torn landscape in which nobles and commoners, heroes and villains, the freeborn and the enslaved, all struggle to survive and to find their destinies...along with the dazzling bounty and wondrous enchantment that was once their birthright in the Seven Kingdoms.","series":{"id":"13201","title":"A Song of Ice and Fire"},"price":"GBP 9.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":22,"average":"6.9","min":0},"subtitle":"Storm分布式实时计算模式","author":["吉奥兹 (P.Taylor Goetz)","奥尼尔 (Brian O'Neill)"],"pubdate":"2015-1-1","tags":[{"count":27,"name":"Storm","title":"Storm"},{"count":18,"name":"大数据","title":"大数据"},{"count":7,"name":"计算机","title":"计算机"},{"count":7,"name":"实时计算","title":"实时计算"},{"count":4,"name":"数据平台","title":"数据平台"},{"count":3,"name":"软件开发","title":"软件开发"},{"count":3,"name":"编程","title":"编程"},{"count":3,"name":"江南白衣推荐","title":"江南白衣推荐"}],"origin_title":"Storm Blueprints Patterns for Distributed Real-Time Computation","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28042751.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":["董昭"],"catalog":"前言\n作者简介\n第1章 分布式单词计数\n1.1 Storm topology的组成部分——stream、spout和bolt\n1.1.1 Storm\n1.1.2 spout\n1.1.3 bolt\n1.2 单词计数topology的数据流\n1.2.1 语句生成bolt\n1.2.2 语句分割bolt\n1.2.3 单词计割bolt\n1.2.4 上报bolt\n1.3 实现单词计数top\n1.3.1 配置开发环境\n1.3.2 实现Sentence\n1.3.3 实现语句分割bolt\n1.3.4 实现单词计割bolt\n1.3.5 实现上报bolt\n1.3.6 实现单词计数topo\n1.4 Storm的并发机制\n1.4.1 WordCountTopology的并发机制\n1.4.2 给topology增加woker\n1.4.3 配置executor和task\n1.5 理解数据流分组\n1.6 有保障机制的数据处理\n1.6.1 spout的可靠性\n1.6.2 bolt的可靠性\n1.6.3 可靠的单词计数\n总结\n第2章 配置Storm集群\n2.1 Storm集群的框架\n2.1.1 理解nimbus守护进程\n2.1.2 supervisor守护进程的工作方式\n2.1.3 Apache ZooKeeper简介\n……\n第3章 Trident和传感器数据\n第4章 实时趋势分析\n第5章 实时图形分析\n第6章 人工智能\n第7章 整合Druid进行金融分析\n第8章 自然语言处理\n第9章 在Hadoop上部署Storm进行广告分析\n第10章 云环境下的S","ebook_url":"https:\/\/read.douban.com\/ebook\/29650694\/","pages":"252","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s28042751.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s28042751.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28042751.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/26312249\/","id":"26312249","publisher":"机械工业出版社","isbn10":"711148438X","isbn13":"9787111484387","title":"大数据技术丛书","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/26312249","alt_title":"Storm Blueprints Patterns for Distributed Real-Time Computation","author_intro":"","summary":"《Storm分布式实时计算模式》由Apache Storm 项目核心贡献者吉奥兹、奥尼尔亲笔撰 写，融合了作者丰富的Storm实战经验，通过大量 示例，全面而系统地讲解使用Storm进行分布式实 时计算的核心概念及应用，并针对不同的应用场 景，给出多种基于Storm的设计模式，为读者快速 掌握Storms分布式实时计算提供系统实践指南。\n《Storm分布式实时计算模式》分为10章：第l章介绍使用storm建立一 个分布式流式计算应用所涉及的核心概念，包括 storm的数据结构、开发环境的搭建，以及Storm 程序的开发和调试技术等；第2章详细讲解storm 集群环境的安装和搭建，以及如何将topology部署 到分布式环境中；第3章通过传感器数据实例详细 介绍Trident topology；第4章讲解如何使用Storm 和Tridentj挂行实时趋势分析；第5章介绍如何使用 Storm进行图形分析，将数据持久化存储在图形数 据库中，通过查询数据来发现其中潜在的联系；第 6章讲解如何在Storm上使用递归实现一个典型的人 工智能算法；第7章演示集成Storm和非事务型系统 的复杂性，通过集成Storm和开源探索性分析架构 Druid实现一个可配置的实时系统来分析金融事件。\n第8章探讨Lambda体系结构的实现方法，讲解如何 将批处理机制和实时处理引擎结合起来构建一个可 纠错的分析系统；第9章讲解如何将Pig脚本转化为 topology，并且使用Storm-YARN部署topology，从 而将批处理系统转化为实时系统；第10章介绍如 何在云服务提供商提供的主机环境下部署和运行 Storm。","ebook_price":"25.00","series":{"id":"19432","title":"大数据技术丛书"},"price":"CNY 59.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Storm","author":["Ghigna, Charles; Ghigna, Debra; Greenseid, Diane"],"pubdate":"2010-9","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7684043.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7684043.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7684043.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7684043.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5999284\/","id":"5999284","publisher":"","isbn10":"0375961143","isbn13":"9780375961144","title":"Barn Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5999284","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This comical introduction to cause and effect is ideal for emergent readers, who look for cues in simple rhymed text and bright, bold art as they take their first steps toward reading independently.\n\nWhen a twister hits the pond near Farmer Brown’s farm, some very odd things happen.

While Storm herself may not be converted, audiences from London to Sydney have been won over by Tim's wordplay and the timely message of the piece in a society where science is attacked as the enemy of belief. Tim's sublime ranty beat-poem weaves through the world we live in, where alternative medicine is given credence and public funding, psychics have primetime TV exposure and people are happy with mystery rather than answers.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"绘本","title":"绘本"},{"count":1,"name":"图书馆的书","title":"图书馆的书"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33520233.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s33520233.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s33520233.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33520233.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/30371295\/","id":"30371295","publisher":"","isbn10":"1536202827","isbn13":"9781536202823","title":"Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/30371295","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":27,"average":"4.8","min":0},"subtitle":"构建大数据实时计算","author":["阿里巴巴集团数据平台事业部商家数据业务部"],"pubdate":"2014-8-1","tags":[{"count":28,"name":"大数据","title":"大数据"},{"count":26,"name":"Storm","title":"Storm"},{"count":7,"name":"编程","title":"编程"},{"count":6,"name":"计算机","title":"计算机"},{"count":4,"name":"Java","title":"Java"},{"count":3,"name":"实时","title":"实时"},{"count":3,"name":"storm","title":"storm"},{"count":2,"name":"分布式","title":"分布式"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28042752.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":[],"catalog":"第1

hospital ravaged by Hurricane Katrina – and her suspenseful portrayal of the quest for truth and justice \n  \nIn the tradition of the best writing on medicine, physician and reporter Sheri Fink reconstructs five days at Memorial Medical Center and draws the reader into the lives of those who struggled mightily to survive and to maintain life amidst chaos.\n \n  After Katrina struck and the floodwaters rose, the power failed, and the heat climbed, exhausted caregivers chose to designate certain patients last for rescue. Months later, several health professionals faced criminal allegations that they deliberately injected numerous patients with drugs to hasten their deaths. \n\n Five Days at Memorial , the culmination of six years of reporting, unspools the mystery of what happened in those days, bringing the reader into a hospital fighting for its life and into a conversation about the most terrifying form of health care rationing.\n\nIn a voice at once involving and fair, masterful and intimate, Fink exposes the hidden dilemmas of end-of-life care and reveals just how ill-prepared we are in America for the impact of large-scale disasters—and how we can do better. A remarkable book, engrossing from start to finish,  Five Days at Memorial  radically transforms your understanding of human nature in crisis.","price":"GBP

A storm-tossed crossing on the North Sea; a catastrophic ferry accident; hundreds dead. Detective Chief Inspector Kate Beauchamp is one of the survivors but her ferocious fight to stay alive brings with it a high cost: a burden of guilt that she should live while some of her friends died; a terror of water; a frozen inner core that never seems to melt. When the body of a young female journalist is found in Aberdeen soon after the disaster, Kate insists on conducting the investigation -- partly to exorcize her own demons, partly because she feels a strange affinity with the victim. The killing is peculiarly brutal and the murderer has left a unique calling card: attached to the woman's neck is a poisonous snake. Into this emotional cauldron steps the last man on earth Kate wants to see -- her estranged father, Frank, in Aberdeen to conduct the marine inquiry into the sinking. Was the disaster the result of a bomb, as claimed by the ferry-line's chairman, or is he trying to hide something? In a sweltering heatwave, Kate and Frank conduct their highly pressured investigations. But for both of them, danger is approaching fast -- a vortex of violence which will sweep them up and endanger their very lives.","price":"124.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Hickman, Wilson"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8326523.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"144","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8326523.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8326523.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8326523.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10115244\/","id":"10115244","publisher":"","isbn10":"1438994125","isbn13":"9781438994123","title":"Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10115244","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Dennis Wilson Jason's normal life is thrown out the window when he gets into a bit of a mishap involving a thunderstorm and a machine at a science demonstration.

MacHale is the author of the bestselling book series Pendragon - Journal of an Adventure Through Time and Space; the spooky Morpheus Road trilogy and the whimsical picture book The Monster Princess. The first book of his new adventure trilogy, SYLO, was published in July of 2013. In addition to his published works, he has written, directed and produced numerous award-winning television series and movies for young people including Are You Afraid of the Dark?; Flight 29 Down and Tower of Terror. D.J. lives with his family in Southern California.","summary":"From D.J. MacHale—the #1 New York Times bestselling author and co-creator of the popular Nickelodeon series Are You Afraid of the Dark?—comes STORM, the exhilarating, action-packed sequel to SYLO:\nAfter a harrowing escape from Pemberwick Island, Tucker Pierce and his surviving friends—Tori, Kent, and Olivia—have finally reached the mainland, only to find that no one is left.\nThat’s not their only sickening discovery. Moments before they are attacked by another of the mysterious black planes, they investigate one’s wreck and are horrified to find that it bears the logo of the U.S. Air Force. This can only mean one thing: the United States is at war with itself—the deadly technology of the Air Force against the brute force of the Navy’s SYLO unit, which still holds Pemberwick Island and its residents captive.\nTucker must lead his friends to safety, but his head is spinning. How can the Air Force be perpetuating such genocide against not only its own citizens, but the world? What is SYLO’s role in this, and why did Tucker’s parents betray him by allying with SYLO, whose commander, Captain Granger, killed Tori’s father at point-blank range? And what did his mother mean when she told him to trust no one?\nTucker, Tori, and friends set off cross-country on a quest for answers and, for Tucker, vengeance. But as one highway gives way to the next—and one death-defying escape precedes another—Tucker soon realizes that “trust no one” doesn’t just mean the U.S. military.","series":{"id":"31828","title":"The SYLO Chronicles"},"price":"USD 17.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Hess, Norah"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/24649622\/","id":"24649622","publisher":"","isbn10":"1477806849","isbn13":"9781477806845","title":"Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/24649622","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Angler, Evan"],"pubdate":"2013-5","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24546015.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s24546015.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s24546015.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24546015.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/20488820\/","id":"20488820","publisher":"","isbn10":"1400321972","isbn13":"9781400321971","title":"Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/20488820","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 11.29"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Nature and Culture","author":["John Withington"],"pubdate":"2016-9-19","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28704264.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"224","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s28704264.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s28704264.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28704264.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/26789340\/","id":"26789340","publisher":"Reaktion Books","isbn10":"1780236611","isbn13":"9781780236612","title":"Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/26789340","alt_title":"","author_intro":"John Withington is an award-winning television journalist and one of Britain's leading disaster historians.

Devastating, diverse, and sometimes appearing completely out of nowhere, storms are also a source of both scientific and aesthetic wonder. In Storm: Nature and Culture, John Withington takes an in-depth and unique look at the nature of storms and the impact that they have – both physical and cultural – on our lives.\nWithington shows how storms have changed the course of human history. From Roman times to the modern day, he shows how their devastating effects have wiped out entire communities, changed the fates of battle, and even reset the entire planet. He also shows how beneficial they have been to us: as an important feature of our atmosphere and climate, but also as a source of inspiration for nearly every artist who has ever lived, from Homer to Rembrandt, in works from the Old Testament to Robinson Crusoe. Beautifully illustrated, Storm: Nature and Culture offers a fascinating look at Earth's most fearsome events.","price":"GBP 17.11"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Reg Grant"],"pubdate":"2006-08","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4330458.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"402","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4330458.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4330458.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4330458.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4805422\/","id":"4805422","publisher":"Wipf & Stock Publishers","isbn10":"1597528544","isbn13":"9781597528542","title":"Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4805422","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 32.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Pritekel, Kim"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5615530.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"236","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5615530.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5615530.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5615530.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4855756\/","id":"4855756","publisher":"","isbn10":"1933720433","isbn13":"9781933720432","title":"Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4855756","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"In Medieval Europe, the name of the game is survival - the stakes are raised when the Black Plague hits in 1349.

sixteen-year-old stowaway discovers her destiny on Noah’s ark in this riveting reimagining from award-winning author Donna Jo Napoli, available in time for the March 2014 major motion picture Noah.The rain starts suddenly, hard and fast. After days of downpour, her family lost, Sebah takes shelter in a tree, eating pine cones and the raw meat of animals that float by. With each passing day, her companion, a boy named Aban, grows weaker. When their tree is struck by lightning, Sebah is tempted just to die in the flames rather than succumb to a slow, watery death. Instead, she and Aban build a raft. What they find on the stormy seas is beyond imagining: a gigantic ark. But Sebah does not know what she’ll find on board, and Aban is too weak to leave their raft. Themes of family, loss, and ultimately, survival and love make for a timeless story. Donna Jo Napoli has imagined a new protagonist to tell the story of Noah and his ark. As rain batters the earth, Noah, his family, and hordes of animals wait out the storm, ready to carry out their duty of repopulating the earth. Hidden below deck…is Sebah.","price":""}]}

Apache Storm, an efficient distributed stream processing platform, does for real-time computation what Hadoop did for batch analysis. Its efficient stream processing capabilities are relied upon by giants like Twitter and Yahoo for swiftly extracting intelligence from their Big Data streams. Fault tolerant guarantees of Storm make it an invaluable and highly versatile platform in the Big Data landscape. It integrates seamlessly with battle-tested message queuing systems (like Kafka) and NoSQL databases (like Cassandra). Storm is built to run on the JVM but provides straightforward extensions for working with non-JVM languages like Ruby and Python.\nStorm Applied is a practical guide to using Apache Storm for the real-world tasks associated with processing and analyzing real-time data streams. This immediately-useful book starts by building a solid foundation of the Storm essentials so that you learn how to think about designing Storm solutions the right way from day one. But it quickly dives into real-world case studies that will bring the novice up to speed with productionizing Storm: the knowledge needed to scale a high throughput stream processor and ensure smooth operation within a production cluster. With that mastery of Storm in hand, it moves on to teach you how to use Trident to treat streams as batches for solving a different class of problems. Finally, it will cover all the different and interesting tools available within the Storm open source community that are crucial for any seasoned Storm developer.","price":"USD 49.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":5,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Patterns for Distributed Real-time Computation","author":["P.

Harry Dresden is a wizard who knows firsthand that the everyday world is actually full of strange and magical things—most of which don't play well with humans.\n\nNow the cops have turned to Dresden to investigate a horrifying double murder that was committed with black magic. Never one to turn down a paycheck, Dresden also takes on another case—to find a missing husband who has quite likely been dabbling in sorcery. As Dresden tries to solve the seemingly unrelated cases, he is confronted with all the Windy City can blow at him, from the mob to mages and all creatures in between.","price":"166.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":246,"average":"8.1","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["[美]里克·穆迪"],"pubdate":"2019-7-20","tags":[{"count":48,"name":"外国文学","title":"外国文学"},{"count":32,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":29,"name":"好书，值得一读","title":"好书，值得一读"},{"count":20,"name":"文学","title":"文学"},{"count":20,"name":"很值得推荐的一本书","title":"很值得推荐的一本书"},{"count":18,"name":"我想读这本书","title":"我想读这本书"},{"count":16,"name":"电影原著","title":"电影原著"},{"count":14,"name":"家庭","title":"家庭"}],"origin_title":"The Ice Storm","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33318366.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":["李睿"],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s33318366.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s33318366.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33318366.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/34432451\/","id":"34432451","publisher":"江苏凤凰文艺出版社","isbn10":"7559438261","isbn13":"9787559438263","title":"冰风暴","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/34432451","alt_title":"The Ice Storm","author_intro":"[美] 里克·穆迪 Rick Moody\n美国著名作家、散文家、作曲家，1961 年生于纽约哈莱姆，哥伦比亚大学艺术硕士学位，目前任教于纽约州立大学。\n他因《冰风暴》(1994)（The Ice Storm）和李安合作，并荣获戛纳电影节最佳编剧。《冰风暴》的故事聚焦在1973 年一个感恩节周末，美国康乃狄克州郊区的两个濒临瓦解的家庭。他的第一部作品《百卉之邦》（1992）获得手推车奖。回忆录《黑纱》获得 玛莎•阿尔布兰奖。他还获得过阿迪生•梅特卡弗奖、《巴黎评论》阿迦汗奖、古根海姆学者奖。作品常见于《纽约客》《时尚先生》《巴黎评论》《纽约时报》等。","summary":"你生于家庭，却又困于家庭，这世上有多少人漠然平静地生活于绝望之中，彼此却是最熟悉的陌生人。\n李安导演作品，戛纳电影节金棕榈奖提名原著，最佳剧本改编大奖，李安30年导演生涯经典之作。从《饮食男女》到《少年派》，从《断背山》到《色戒》，《冰风暴》才是李安最满意的作品。\n豆瓣电影8.0分，李安式的家庭话题文艺片。直面原生家庭困境、中年婚姻危机等。\n一个普通平静的美国中产家庭，时代的大潮把他们推进了混乱的边缘。平凡乏味的家庭生活使中年的夫妻厌倦，丈夫本·胡德一直在引诱邻居珍妮特·哈珀，而妻子对丈夫的谎言也早已不耐烦了，她与一双儿女无意中目睹了丈夫与女邻居偷情的场面，夫妻间一场情感风暴即将爆发。\n用冰风暴的变换来比喻家庭结构的破碎是李安的想法，家就像冰一样，看似坚固，实际脆弱。在冰风暴的那天晚上，这两个家庭历经分崩离析，次日清晨，大家都觉醒了，我们都将重新面对一切。\n   李安：“我重看自己拍的电影，总能找出不少瑕疵，但这一部，是最少的，也是最完美的一部。”\n李安摸着胸口说：“除非我这里有感觉，否则我不拍这部电影。里克·穆迪的这本书让我感动，很合我的胃口。《冰风暴》是我的第二部英语电影，也是我从通俗喜剧转向悲剧电影的尝试……这本书讲的是我一直在电影中经营的主题之——家。家有缺点，但家人间相濡以沫的凝聚力，常让人有着温暖莫名的感动。”\n《冰风暴》是有史以来最成功的家庭题材著作。里克·穆迪通过事无巨细的细节描写，还原了那个时代萦绕郊区的焦虑。他笔下的角色有种被冰冻的感情，以至于我们读起来会有种“冷眼旁观”的感受，仿佛只是静静等待他们生命走到最后，我们一直在冷静地阅读着，冷入骨髓。\n——《卫报》","price":"45.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":6,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Feast for Crows","author":["George R.R.

The authors, however, bring this story alive in a fast-moving book, and the reader sees how events of that time are very relevant for today's financial world. In spite of all of our advances, including a stronger monetary system and modern tools for managing risk, Bruner and Carr help us understand that we are not immune to a future crisis.\"\n    —Dwight B. Crane, Baker Foundation Professor, Harvard Business School         \"Bruner and Carr provide a thorough, masterly, and highly readable account of the 1907 crisis and its management by the great private banker J. P. Morgan. Congress heeded the lessons of 1907, launching the Federal Reserve System in 1913 to prevent banking panics and foster financial stability. We still have financial problems. But because of 1907 and Morgan, a century later we have a respected central bank as well as greater confidence in our money and our banks than our great-grandparents had in theirs.\"\n    —Richard Sylla, Henry Kaufman Professor of the History of Financial Institutions and Markets, and Professor of Economics, Stern School of Business, New York University         \"A fascinating portrayal of the events and personalities of the crisis and panic of 1907. Lessons learned and parallels to the present have great relevance. Crises and panics are as much a part of our future as our past.\"\n    —John Strangfeld, Vice Chairman, Prudential Financial         \"Who would have thought that a hundred years after the Panic of 1907 so much remained to be written about it? Bruner and Carr break significant new ground because they are willing to do the heavy lifting of combing through massive archival material to identify and weave together important facts. Their book will be of interest not only to banking theorists and financial historians, but also to business school and economics students, for its rare ability to teach so clearly why and how a panic unfolds.\"\n    —Charles Calomiris, Henry Kaufman Professor of Financial Institutions, Columbia University, Graduate School of Business","price":"USD

Teenage stowaway Jack Sparrow has assembled a motley crew, and theyre on the quest of a lifetime. Their goal: to locate and procure the legendary Sword of Corts, which will grant them unimaginable power. But will this ragtag team of adventurers survive their first mission, or will they succumb to the power of the sea, vicious pirates, and ancient curses? \n\n About  Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow  \nPirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow is a series for young readers of nine to twelve years written by Rob Kidd. The series are prequels to the Pirates of the Caribbean films. The series details Jack Sparrow's teen years prior to the events of the movies.\n\n About  Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow　The coming storm　  \nRelease Date: June 1, 2006 (USA) In the beginning Jack is in a Tortuga tavern, looking for his satchel, which has been stolen. He thinks he has found it under the seat of a notorious pirate Torrents, who catches Jack stealing. In the ensuing bar fight, Jack slips out, only to find out that the satchel isn't his. This one contains, among various personal items, the magical sheath for the Sword of Cortés. The bar attendant, Arabella, who pulled Jack out of the fight, makes this discovery with him. They plan together to a ship to go look for the storied Sword of Cortés, and reunite it with its sheath. Arabella directs Jack to an abandoned ship, the Barnacle. Before they leave Tortuga, a young boy, Fitzwilliam P. Dalton III, insists on joining them for their quest. The three sail for many days and come upon an island, where they meet two thirteen year old boys, Jean and Tumen, and their cat sister Constance. Jack remarks about The Sword of Cortés, and Jean and Tumen lead the crew to a 'dead' city on the cursed island. Inside the main building of the city, the crew find the skeleton of the city's king, Stone-Eyed Sam, who is said to be holding the Sword, but it is missing. Jack pockets the fabled stone eye of the now-dead former pirate king as a souvenir. The crew find left footprints on the ground, and soon realize that the notorious pirate, Left Foot Louis, has it. They all go rushing to the Barnacle, when they suddenly come face to face with Torrents, a crew member of the feared Davy Jones's crew. They all battle on the beach, for who would get the Sword of Cortés's sheath, and Jack eventually defeats Torrents (look out for a reference to Ben Franklin!) and escape on the Barnacle.\n\nIt is revealed in this book that Jack knew Benjamin Franklin, and taught him the secrets of electricity.\n\n Book Dimension   \nlength: (cm)18.9 　 width:(cm)14.5","price":"USD 4.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":4,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"and the Big Storm","author":["Norman Bridwell"],"pubdate":"1995-4","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"英文绘本","title":"英文绘本"},{"count":1,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":1,"name":"绘本","title":"绘本"},{"count":1,"name":"童书","title":"童书"},{"count":1,"name":"Clifford系列","title":"Clifford系列"},{"count":1,"name":"0－3岁第三阶段","title":"0－3岁第三阶段"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8506008.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8506008.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8506008.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8506008.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2094528\/","id":"2094528","publisher":"0-590","isbn10":"0590257552","isbn13":"9780590257558","title":"Clifford AND THE BIG STORM","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2094528","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"在线阅读本书\n\n  When a hurricane strikes while Clifford and Emily Elizabeth are having fun visiting her grandmother at the beach, Clifford the big red dog knows just what to do to keep everyone safe.","price":"30.0"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Feast for Crows, a Storm of Swords: Steel and Snow: Part 1 of, a Clash of Kings, a Game of Thrones, a ... 2: Blood and Gold & a Dance with Dragons","author":["George R.

Having taken the reader from the foundation of the GDR, through the peaceful revolution, to the unification of Germany, the story ends with some reflections on the church's past as well as on the challenges it faces in present-day Europe. \"Protestants in Communist East Germany\" makes a unique contribution to existing literature by drawing not only on written sources but on a series of first-hand interviews with theologians, pastors and lay people of different ages whose experiences, views and analyses bring the story to life. The East German church's relationship to the state will probably always remain controversial and the vision for a different socialism in the GDR espoused by those involved in the peaceful revolution may now be considered illusionary. Nevertheless, many of the issues raised by the Protestants in the GDR remain as vital challenges to the churches in Europe today.\nShow More\nShow Less","price":"USD 119.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"'August Storm'","author":["David Glantz"],"pubdate":"2003-2-27","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"军事史","title":"军事史"},{"count":2,"name":"战争史","title":"战争史"},{"count":1,"name":"苏联","title":"苏联"},{"count":1,"name":"历史","title":"历史"},{"count":1,"name":"二战","title":"二战"},{"count":1,"name":"Glantz","title":"Glantz"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s14333588.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"368","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s14333588.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s14333588.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s14333588.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/12294480\/","id":"12294480","publisher":"Routledge","isbn10":"0714653004","isbn13":"9780714653006","title":"Soviet Operational and Tactical Combat in Manchuria, 1945","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/12294480","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"On 9 August 1945 a force of over 1.5 million Red Army soldiers employed extensive and imaginative maneuver to overcome terrain thought to be inpenetrable.

To accomplish this unprecedented feat, the Soviet High Command had to transfer more than 500,000 troops, 7000 guns and mortars, 2000 tanks, 17,000 trucks, and thousands of tons of military equipment and supplies up to 6000 miles from European Russia to the Far East in one of the most massive and rapid military regroupings in history. Volume II covers the detailed course of operational and tactical fighting in virtually every combat sector.","price":"USD 168.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":6,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"like a storm","author":["雨木シュウスケ","深遊"],"pubdate":"2014-4-8","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"轻小说","title":"轻小说"},{"count":2,"name":"雨木シュウスケ","title":"雨木シュウスケ"},{"count":1,"name":"钢壳都市","title":"钢壳都市"}],"origin_title":"鋼殻のレギオス23 ライク・ア・ストーム","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27247683.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":["梁恩嘉"],"catalog":"","pages":"244","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s27247683.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s27247683.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27247683.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/25832263\/","id":"25832263","publisher":"台灣角川","isbn10":"986325889X","isbn13":"9789863258896","title":"鋼殼都市雷吉歐斯 23","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/25832263","alt_title":"鋼殻のレギオス23 ライク・ア・ストーム","author_intro":"作者：雨木シュウケス\n以第十五屆奇幻長篇小說大賞佳作《マテリアルナイト 少女は巨人と踊る》一書出道。\n插畫：深遊\n插畫家。除了小說插畫之外也負責執筆《鋼殼都市雷吉歐斯》的漫畫。","summary":"★壯大的世界觀與錯縱複雜的人物關係\n★史上最強的學園動作科幻故事\n古連丹王家的武藝家庫拉麗貝．隆斯麥亞，也就是庫拉拉，有一件打從心底渴望著的事物。\n那就是──與雷馮來一場決鬥。接二連三挑戰到了最後（庫拉拉單方面的），\n庫拉拉漸漸明白自己對雷馮的情感──\n「使用『這個』，向雷馮進行最後的挑戰！」\n表明決心的她手中握著小瓶子。滿滿裝在那裡面的謎樣液體的藥效，以及庫拉拉的新野心究竟是？\n以擁有天劍繼承者級的力量與技巧的「風暴少女」庫拉拉為中心，\n潔爾妮將要刮起戰鬥與戀情（？）的風暴，將雷馮，菲麗，妮娜等人，\n以及學園都市的人們捲入其中！","series":{"id":"2319","title":"鋼殼都市雷吉歐斯"},"price":"NT$180"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Album Art of Storm Thorgerson","author":["Storm Thorgerson"],"pubdate":"2013-10","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"装帧与设计","title":"装帧与设计"},{"count":1,"name":"艺术与音乐","title":"艺术与音乐"},{"count":1,"name":"(English)","title":"(English)"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27199026.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"208","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s27199026.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s27199026.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27199026.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/25809214\/","id":"25809214","publisher":"StormStudios and de Milo.","isbn10":"1905662076","isbn13":"9781905662074","title":"The Gathering Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/25809214","alt_title":"","author_intro":"The story of Storm Thorgerson’s career begins in 1968 as a founder member of the British graphic art group Hipgnosis.

Heavily armoured, highly mobile and capable of killing at over 2500m the M1 Abrams is, to this day, a veritable fighting machine. Superior to both Iraq's Soviet era T-55 and T-62 tanks, nearly all sources claim that no Abrams tank has ever been destroyed by enemy fire. Despite entering service in 1980, the M1 Abrams remained untested in combat until the Gulf War in 1991, where it was to be confronted by its archenemy the Iraqi-assembled Soviet-designed T-72. Entering production in 1971, the T-72 arguably outstripped its contemporaries in a balance of mobility, protection and firepower. By the time of Operation Desert Storm, however, the tables had turned and the tank suffered due to low quality ammunition and poorly trained crews. In this fascinating study, Steven Zaloga pits these two great fighting machines against one another, plotting the development of the Cold War until both tanks met in combat in the deserts of Iraq and Kuwait.","price":"USD 17.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"How to Ride a Dragon's Storm","author":["Cowell, Cressida"],"pubdate":"2011-6","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"writen","title":"writen"},{"count":1,"name":"well","title":"well"},{"count":1,"name":"CressidaCowell","title":"CressidaCowell"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6347336.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"254","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6347336.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6347336.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6347336.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6400249\/","id":"6400249","publisher":"Little Brown UK","isbn10":"031607909X","isbn13":"9780316079099","title":"How to Train Your Dragon Book 7","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6400249","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, everyone's favorite reluctant Viking hero, has three months, five days and six hours to discover America, get back to Berk, save his father, battle Polarserpents, and win the annual Inter-Tribal Friendly Swimming Race.

Crane, Baker Foundation Professor, Harvard Business School       \"Bruner and Carr provide a thorough, masterly, and highly readable account of the 1907 crisis and its management by the great private banker J.

Through the tight lens of four months, Juliet Nicolson’s rich storytelling gifts rivet us with the sights, colors, and feelings of a bygone era. That summer of 1911 a new king was crowned and the aristocracy was at play, bounding from one house party to the next. But perfection was not for all. Cracks in the social fabric were showing. The country was brought to a standstill by industrial strikes. Temperatures rose steadily to more than 100 degrees; by August deaths from heatstroke were too many for newspapers to report. Drawing on material from intimate and rarely seen sources and narrated through the eyes of a series of exceptional individuals — among them a debutante, a choirboy, a politician, a trade unionist, a butler, and the Queen — The Perfect Summer is a vividly rendered glimpse of the twilight of the Edwardian era.","price":"USD 25.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Operation Storm - Secret War in the Middle East","author":["Tony Jeapes"],"pubdate":"2005-4-15","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3968196.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"247","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3968196.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3968196.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3968196.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2949656\/","id":"2949656","publisher":"Greenhill Books","isbn10":"1853675679","isbn13":"9781853675676","title":"SAS","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2949656","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP 15.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Rising Storm","author":["Hunter, Erin"],"pubdate":"2004-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7666815.jpg","binding":"LIB","translator":[],"catalog":"","ebook_url":"https:\/\/read.douban.com\/ebook\/56372052\/","pages":"336","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7666815.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7666815.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7666815.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2581607\/","id":"2581607","publisher":"Harpercollins","isbn10":"0060525622","isbn13":"9780060525620","title":"Warriors #4","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2581607","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Fire alone can save our clan...

Martin's stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.\nA Storm of Swords\nOf the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King's Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world....\nBut as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others--a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in averitable storm of swords. . .","price":"GBP 14.26"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The true story of a Chicago Student held as a POW by the Americans During Desert Storm","author":["Shant Kenderian"],"pubdate":"","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"war","title":"war"},{"count":1,"name":"US","title":"US"},{"count":1,"name":"Iraq","title":"Iraq"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2804856.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"290","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s2804856.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s2804856.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2804856.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2344439\/","id":"2344439","publisher":"Booksurge Llc","isbn10":"1419619055","isbn13":"9781419619052","title":"1001 Nights in Iraq","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2344439","alt_title":"","author_intro":"About the Author\nShant Kenderian received his undergraduate degree in engineering in Baghdad.

But then Saddam Hussein invaded Iran and sealed off Iraq’s borders to every man of military age —including Shant. Suddenly forced onto the front lines, his two–week visit turned into a nightmare that lasted for ten years.\n1001 Nights in Iraq presents a human story that provides unique insight into a country and culture that we only get a hint of in the headlines. After surviving the horrors of the Iran–Iraq War, Shant was then forced to fight on the front lines of Desert Storm without being given the proper equipment, including a gun, but miraculously survived to be captured by the Americans and become a POW. He underwent starvation, heavy interrogations, and solitary confinement, but what broke him in the end was his love affair with a female American soldier.

Ruled by the military for half its existence, it has seen three wars with India and the loss of much of its territory. The combination of political instability, deep-seated economic and social problems, and access to nuclear weapons has made it one of the most strategically sensitive countries in the world. The war in neighbouring Afghanistan has placed it at the very centre of global attention and projected its military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, onto the world stage. Musharraf has become the first Pakistani leader in 30 years to dare to confront the country's Islamic extremists. But can he succeed in controlling the forces that helped create the Taliban in Afghanistan and fuelled the bitter conflict in Kashmir? Will his army and intelligence agencies be able to tame the radical elements that they created and sustained? In this history of Pakistan from 1947 to the present, Owen Bennett Jones describes the many fault lines in Pakistani society.  He assesses the role of the nationalists in the provinces, the feudal landlords in the countryside, and the bureaucratic elite in Islamabad, and analyzes the complex relationships between religion, regional politics, and the armed forces. While most Pakistanis have a moderate, tolerant vision of Islam, he argues, the country's central institutions are so weak that the military regime may prove incapable of rescuing the \"failed state\" of Pakistan. As a BBC correspondent in Pakistan between 1998 and 2001 Bennett Jones witnessed at first hand many of the events that brought General Musharraf to power. His book contains the first detailed accounts of the 1999 coup, the Kargil conflict, and how Pakistan came to test its nuclear bomb. It should be of interest to anyone who wants to understand a country that was crucial to the expulsion of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in the 1980s and which, after the 11th September 2001 attack, became a key coalition partner in America's \"war against terrorism\".","price":"USD 35.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Perfect  Storm: Hurricane Katrina, The Bush White House, and Beyond","author":["Michael D.

In 1861, Amelia Martin's father is stripped of his post as a ship's captain when he is caught harboring the leader of a slave rebellion. Now he is an assistant lighthouse keeper on Fenwick Island, off the coast of Delaware -- a state wedged between the North and the South, just as Amelia is wedged between her warring parents. Amelia's mother blames her abolitionist husband for their living conditions, which she claims are taking a toll on her health. Amelia observes her mother's hate and her father's admiration for Abraham Lincoln.      But slavery is the deeper issue separating the two sides. As the Civil War rages on, Amelia slowly learns that she cannot stop the fighting, but by keeping watch in the lighthouse each day, lighting the lamps, cleaning the glass, and rescuing victims of Atlantic storms, she can still make a difference.

Mankel's compelling books about the idealistic police inspector have sold more than 30 million copies in 43 different languages and inspired more than 25 film adaptations. This book explores how in Europe, readers took instantly to the troubled, lonely cop with his horrendous health problems and catastrophic home life. It also demonstrates the new fanbase given the character since Kenneth Branagh has taken on the central role in the acclaimed and award-winning series, and British and American fans have really taken Wallander to their hearts. It discusses the effect on the small Swedish town of Ystad, now one of the country's top tourist attractions as many British and American visitors are lining up to visit murder scenes and immerse themselves in the bleak landscape made famous on screen. Yet Wallander is much more than just another TV crime series—Henning Mankel invented the caring policeman as a vehicle to write about the disturbing increase in violence and racism that was undermining the comfortable social democracy of Sweden. Those problems are as international as Wallander's appeal.","price":"$ 28.19"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Axis & Allies, Europa Universalis III, Making History: The Calm & the Storm","author":["Source Wikipedia","Books, LLC 编"],"pubdate":"2011-6","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26228813.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"30","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s26228813.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s26228813.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26228813.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/14122284\/","id":"14122284","publisher":"Books LLC, Wiki Series","isbn10":"1156127017","isbn13":"9781156127018","title":"Grand Strategy Video Games","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/14122284","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 15.98"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Operation Storm: SAS in Oman","author":["Tony Jeapes"],"pubdate":"2000-3-6","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29469949.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"352","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29469949.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29469949.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29469949.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/11642414\/","id":"11642414","publisher":"HarperCollins","isbn10":"000472514X","isbn13":"9780004725147","title":"SAS Secret War","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/11642414","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP 5.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Calm Within the Storm","author":["Robert J.

After wild encounters with vicious cannibals, deadly snakes, and tribal kings, Du Chaillu emerged with 20 preserved gorilla skins—two of which were stuffed and brought on tour—and walked smack dab into the biggest scientific debate of the time: Darwin's theory of evolution. Quickly, Du Chaillu's trophies went from objects of wonder to key pieces in an all-out intellectual war.

The book is based on tidal waters of Maryland, Virginia, Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic regions known to the author, and also provides international examples from the UK and different locations around the world, which allows readers to compare and contrast tidal regimes and to perform tidal analysis from data in their own environment. It is an important book for teachers, researchers, planners and engineers responsible for coastal defences as well as new infrastructure and waterway modification in ports and harbours. The wealth of informative detail and data provided makes this text worthwhile for readers who need a wider understanding of this increasingly important topic for coastal zone residents. MATLAB scientific programming language, simple-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI) programs are introduced for students, researchers and engineering consultants, available at no cost from MATLAB Central file exchange (http:\/\/www mathworks.com\/matlabcentral). GUI programs provide the tools for analysing water level or water current observations, deriving the major tidal constituents, and showing first hand how tide and tidal current predictions are made in addition to producing unrivalled colour graphic visualisations. GUI is the author's tidal analysis and is particularly suited for the investigation of storm surge in coastal waters. Professor Boon has studied tidal behaviour in world coastal zones and here assembles information for public and private use from his capacity as advisor to state and federal authorities and corporate organisations.","price":"USD 90.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Storm Clouds over the Pacific, 1931–41","author":["Peter Harmsen"],"pubdate":"2018-12-20","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29756936.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29756936.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29756936.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29756936.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/30210974\/","id":"30210974","publisher":"Casemate","isbn10":"1612004806","isbn13":"9781612004808","title":"War in the Asia Pacific","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/30210974","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP 25.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Storm and Silence Saga Book 1","author":["Robert Thier"],"pubdate":"2016-3-18","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"mobi","title":"mobi"},{"count":1,"name":"Wattpad","title":"Wattpad"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29994884.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"596","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29994884.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29994884.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29994884.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/30449676\/","id":"30449676","publisher":"Robert Thier; 1 edition","isbn10":"3000513515","isbn13":"9783000513510","title":"Storm and Silence","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/30449676","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Robert Thier is a German Historian and writer of Historical Fiction. His particular mix of history, romance and adventure, always with a good deal of humor thrown in, has gained him a diverse readership ranging from teenagers to retired grandmothers. For the way he manages to make history come alive, as if he himself had lived as a medieval knight, his fans all over the world have given him the nickname “Sir Rob”. For him, Robert says, becoming a writer has followed naturally from his interest in history. “In Germany,” he says, “we use the same word for story and history. And I've always loved the one as much as the other. Becoming a storyteller, a writer, is what I've always wanted.” Besides writing and researching in dusty old archives, on the lookout for a mystery to put into his next story, Robert enjoys classical music and long walks in the country. The helmet you see on the picture he does not wear because he is a cycling enthusiast, but to protect his literary skull in which a bone has been missing from birth. Robert lives in the south of Germany in a small village between the three Emperor's Mountains.","summary":"Freedom – that is what Lilly Linton wants most in life.

Featuring such disasters as the wreck of the now-famous fishing boat the Andrea Gail during the \"perfect storm, \" the nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island, and the Exxon Valdez oil spill, this new Rosen Central series is perfect for use as part of the social studies curriculum. The books illustrate the dangers to the individual and to society posed by an incomplete mastery of technology and a misplaced faith in human competence and judgment. The gripping accounts of these tragic events are supplemented with compelling narrative timelines and enthralling firsthand testimonies. Each title includes a discussion of how, in the aftermath of tragedy, changes in technology and procedure were brought about to help ensure that a similar disaster would never strike again. Author Gillian Houghton brings to vivid life the maritime culture of Gloucester, the rough-and-tumble existence on a swordishing boat, and the desperate lives of the swordfishers that make taking dangerous risks with the weather a necessity. Included in this compelling story are first-person observations of the crew's friends and family, accounts of radio messages from the Andrea Gail's captain, and a timeline that charts the ship's last turbulent hours. Also included are photos of the Andrea Gail that have never been published before","price":"USD 26.50"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"How Eric Clapton Took the World by Storm","author":["Thompson, Dave"],"pubdate":"2010-3","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6857445.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"320","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6857445.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6857445.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6857445.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2807881\/","id":"2807881","publisher":"St Martins Pr","isbn10":"0753511320","isbn13":"9780753511329","title":"Cream","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2807881","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Dave Thompson, author of Virgin's acclaimed Red Hot Chili Peppers biography, takes a new and very detailed look at the creation of one of the world's most influential bands.

In this steamy conclusion to her Stewart Sisters trilogy, JoAnn Ross crafts a sizzling romantic suspense story of sex, sin, and scandal.  There's no escaping the sweltering heat when White House correspondent Laurel Stewart arrives in Somersett, South Carolina, and discovers that her best friend -- the vice president's protocol advisor -- has disappeared. As frustrated as she is by Detective Joe Gannon's skepticism regarding her suspicions, Laurel finds his smooth-talking southern ways and brazen bedroom eyes disturbingly, dangerously, seductive.  With the homicide rate escalating as fast as the mercury, the last thing Joe needs is a stubborn, argumentative reporter -- particularly not an outsider from Washington, D.C., who triggers a sexual jolt at every encounter -- spinning her crazy conspiracy theories. But while he may not entirely believe Laurel Stewart, Joe can't stop himself from wanting her. Thrown together by necessity, drawn together by passion, Laurel and Joe follow a twisted trail into the darkest corners of the sultry, moss-draped city to uncover a secret someone is willing to kill to keep.","price":"59.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"I Feel Like a Storm Cloud","author":["Evans, Lezlie\/ Carrington, Marsha Gray (ILT)"],"pubdate":"1999-3","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5557152.jpg","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5557152.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5557152.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5557152.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2652340\/","id":"2652340","publisher":"Mondo Pub","isbn10":"1572556218","isbn13":"9781572556218","title":"Sometimes I Feel Like a Storm Cloud","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2652340","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Did you ever feel like a storm cloud?Sometimes I feel like a storm cloud -- a big, dark, rumbling, grumbling rain cloud, ready to burst into a shower of tears.

At least 6,000 of the city's 38,000 residents died in the hurricane. Many observers predicted that Galveston would never recover and urged that the island be abandoned. Instead, the citizens of Galveston seized the opportunity, not just to rebuild, but to reinvent the city in a thoughtful, intentional way that reformed its government, gave women a larger role in its public life, and made it less vulnerable to future storms and flooding. This extensively illustrated history tells the full story of the 1900 Storm and its long-term effects. The authors draw on survivors' accounts to vividly recreate the storm and its aftermath. They describe the work of local relief agencies, aided by Clara Barton and the American Red Cross, and show how their short-term efforts grew into lasting reforms. At the same time, the authors reveal that not all Galvestonians benefited from the city's rebirth, as African Americans found themselves increasingly shut out from civic participation by Jim Crow segregation laws. As the centennial of the 1900 Storm prompts remembrance and reassessment, this complete account will be essential and fascinating reading for all who seek to understand Galveston's destruction and rebirth. Patricia Bellis Bixel is a professional historian and assistant editor of the Journal of Southern History at Rice University. Elizabeth Hayes Turner is Associate Professor of History at the University of Houston-Downtown.","price":"$ 39.49"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Operation: Galactic Storm","author":["Mark Gruenwald","Tom DeFalco","Bob Harras","Gerard Jones","Roy Thomas"],"pubdate":"2008-2-12","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28937995.jpg","binding":"Library Binding","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"280","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s28937995.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s28937995.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28937995.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4491585\/","id":"4491585","publisher":"Paw Prints 2008-02-12","isbn10":"1435224876","isbn13":"9781435224872","title":"Avengers 1","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4491585","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 38.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"v. 2, No. 1: Storm Pocket Manga","author":["Wight, Joseph"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7572290.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7572290.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7572290.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7572290.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7145605\/","id":"7145605","publisher":"","isbn10":"1932453636","isbn13":"9781932453638","title":"Twilight X","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7145605","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"120.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Storm Within\\The Reluctant Queen","author":["Morey, Trish; Crews, Caitlin;"],"pubdate":"2011-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7081284.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"192","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7081284.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7081284.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7081284.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6933319\/","id":"6933319","publisher":"","isbn10":"0373130287","isbn13":"9780373130283","title":"A Royal Engagement","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6933319","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 5.64"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Storm Hawks","author":[],"pubdate":"2009-7","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9083742.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s9083742.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s9083742.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9083742.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6977043\/","id":"6977043","publisher":"Scholastic Academic","isbn10":"1905775385","isbn13":"9781905775385","title":"Starter level","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6977043","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Extensive reading improves fluency and there is a real need in the ELT classroom for contemporary, motivating material that will instantly appeal to students with a limited knowledge of English. \"Storm Hawks: Best Friends Forever\" is based on an episode from the popular animated TV show, \"Storm Hawks\".

Arriving In London in 1816 the three sisters forged their own destinies in the face of intense prejudice, against both Americans and Catholics.

The four Caton sisters were descended from the first settlers in Maryland, and brought up in Baltimore by their grandfather Charles Carroll, one of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence. These Catholic Southern belleswere expected to 'marry a Plantation'. But they were independent, fascinated by politics, clever with money, romantic in mood. Arriving in Britain, Marianne, Louisa and Bess were swept into the set of the Duke of Wellington, who loved Marianne until his death. In London the three sisters forged their own destinies in the face of intense prejudice, against both Americans and Catholics. (Meanwhile, Marianne's sister-in-law Betseyhad married Napoleon's younger brother Joseph, to the Emperor's fury, and found herself abandoned in Paris.) While Emily stayed at home, marrying a Scots-Canadian entrepreneur and running the Baltimore households, the widowed Marianne shocked the world by marrying the Wellington's wayward elder brother, the Duke of Wellesley, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and appearing as a 'Catholic Yankee' among the Protestant Anglo-Irish. Louisa eventually became Duchess of Leeds, and a friend of Queen Victoria, while the sphere in which Bess shone was the stockmarket, as queen of speculators. Based on intimate unpublished letters, Sisters of Fortune is a glorious book. Everything is here -childbirth and coronets, gossip and politics, the call of faith - and, above all, the power of wealth. This is a brilliant portrait of love between sisters and of Anglo-American relations through this period. But it is also a most unusual story of money, of the power it gave these women, particularly over the men in their lives, and how it shaped social and even international relations round them.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Transforming Power of a Storm","author":["Grizzle, Eric

But often it goes misdiagnosed, and kids can be prescribed medication that only worsens the condition. With her twenty-five years’ experience, child psychiatrist Rosalie Greenberg offers parents and professionals alike an innovative approach to help bipolar youngsters locate that elusive inner calm. Gathering stories from families on the front lines, she shows parents how best to navigate the peaks and valleys of the disorder, addresses family relationships, and guides parents in making meaningful choices about their child’s education and treatment options. A masterful book that recognizes the brilliance and creativity in bipolar kids, it will give hope that every child can, with the proper interventions, lead a full, productive life.","price":"116.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Storm Shadow - Solo v. 1","author":["Hama, Larry\/ Robinson, Mark A.

Allied with Black Hole, Multiplex, Negative Flash and Raijin, Master of Lightning, Grodd comes to Central City to drain the energy from all of the speedsters!\nIn the back of Barry's mind, Grodd is gnawing at his memories and scratching at scars, inflicting psychic wounds that may have lasting effects.

The fourth volume of Melvyn C. Goldstein's History of Modern Tibet series, In the Eye of the Storm, provides new perspectives on Sino-Tibetan history during the period leading to the Tibetan Uprising of 1959. The volume also reassesses issues that have been widely misunderstood as well as stereotypes and misrepresentations in the popular realm and in academic literature (such as in Mao’s policies on Tibet). Volume 4 draws on important new Chinese government documents, published and unpublished memoirs, new biographies, and a large corpus of in-depth, specially collected political interviews to reexamine the events that produced the March 10th uprising and the demise of Tibet’s famous Buddhist civilization. The result is a heavily documented analysis that presents a nuanced and balanced account of the principal players and their policies during the critical final two years of Sino-Tibetan relations under the Seventeen-Point Agreement of 1951.","price":"$85"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":84,"average":"9.7","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["George R.R.

Martin sold his first story in 1971 and has been writing professionally ever since. He has written fantasy, horror, and science fiction, and for his sins spent ten years in Hollywood as a writer\/producer, working on Twilight Zone, Beauty and the Beast, and various feature films and television pilots that were never made. In the mid 90s he returned to prose, his first love, and began work on his epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire. He has been in the Seven Kingdoms ever since. Whenever he's allowed to leave, he returns to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he lives with the lovely Parris, a big white dog called Mischa, and two cats named Augustus and Caligula who think they run the place.","summary":"《冰与火之歌》英国版\nSplit into two books for the paperback, the third volume in George R.R. Martin's superb and highly acclaimed epic fantasy A Song of Ice and Fire continues the richest, most exotic and mesmerising saga since The Lord of the Rings. The Seven Kingdoms are divided by revolt and blood feud, and winter approaches like an angry beast. Beyond the Northern borders, wildlings leave their villages to gather in the ice and stone wasteland of the Frostfangs. From there, the renegade Brother Mance Rayder will lead them South towards the Wall. Robb Stark wears his new-forged crown in the Kingdom of the North, but his defences are ranged against attack from the South, the land of House Stark's enemies the Lannisters. His sisters are trapped there, dead or likely yet to die, at the whim of the Lannister boy-king Joffrey or his depraved mother Cersei, regent of the Iron Throne. And Daenerys Stormborn will return to the land of her birth to avenge the murder of her father, the last Dragon King on the Iron Throne.","series":{"id":"5913","title":"A Song of Ice and Fire"},"price":"£8.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":15,"average":"7.8","min":0},"subtitle":"1400年的伊斯蘭聖戰","author":["米爾頓·費歐斯特(Viorst, Milton )"],"pubdate":"2009\/3\/1","tags":[{"count":15,"name":"历史","title":"历史"},{"count":11,"name":"中东","title":"中东"},{"count":8,"name":"伊斯兰","title":"伊斯兰"},{"count":6,"name":"歷史","title":"歷史"},{"count":3,"name":"宗教","title":"宗教"},{"count":3,"name":"2009","title":"2009"},{"count":2,"name":"MiltonViorst","title":"MiltonViorst"},{"count":2,"name":"2013","title":"2013"}],"origin_title":"Storm from the East: The Struggle Between the Arab World and the Christian West","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3672381.jpg","binding":"平裝本","translator":["謝佩妏"],"catalog":"地圖\n前言\n1古老記憶　622-1900\n2挺身反抗　1901-1918\n3理想幻滅　1919-1939\n4解放之路　1940-1956\n5分分合合　1957-1967\n6神權政治與獨裁政治　1968-2005\n結語\n資料來源\n注解","pages":"256頁","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3672381.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3672381.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3672381.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3611775\/","id":"3611775","publisher":"左岸文化事業有限公司","isbn10":"9866723186","isbn13":"9789866723186","title":"以阿拉之名","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3611775","alt_title":"Storm from the East: The Struggle Between the Arab World and the Christian West","author_intro":"米爾頓．費歐斯特\n是《紐約客》雜誌的中東特派員，從一九六○年代開始報導中東新聞。他也是該領域的學者，作品散見於《紐約時報》、《華盛頓郵報》、《洛杉磯時報》和《華爾街日報》等報章。至今已出版六本中東方面的著作。目前跟妻子，詩人茱蒂?費歐斯特，住在華盛頓特區。\n譯者簡介\n謝佩妏\n譯有《城市的歷史》《失敗的國家》《微國家》《美的線條》","summary":"資深記者及中東學者米爾頓‧費歐斯特，清楚明白、持平生動地勾勒出美國與阿拉伯世界之間多年來的恩恩怨怨。他認為，除非美國以首的西方國家，尊重阿拉伯人想要自己決定命運的決心，不然中東地區發生的激烈衝突不可能緩和。\n作者在書中紀錄了西方和中東阿拉伯世界之間，長達一千四百年的往來互動，深入探討阿拉伯人設法推翻西方霸權的長期抗爭過程。此外，他也描繪阿拉伯人經歷過的民主政治和軍事獨裁統治，並細細推論納瑟社會主義、阿拉伯復興主義、伊斯蘭教的極端主義等政治運動，為何都擁有同樣的目標：解放阿拉伯人，掙脫外強的控制。","price":"NT$ 280"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":9,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Childhood Lost in Chaos","author":["Emily Wu","Larry Engelmann"],"pubdate":"2008-1-8","tags":[{"count":15,"name":"回忆录","title":"回忆录"},{"count":11,"name":"传记","title":"传记"},{"count":9,"name":"文革","title":"文革"},{"count":7,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":6,"name":"历史","title":"历史"},{"count":4,"name":"中国近代史","title":"中国近代史"},{"count":3,"name":"中国","title":"中国"},{"count":3,"name":"Memoir","title":"Memoir"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29274780.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"333","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29274780.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29274780.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29274780.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3817303\/","id":"3817303","publisher":"Anchor","isbn10":"0307276627","isbn13":"9780307276629","title":"Feather in the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3817303","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 17.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":48,"average":"7.6","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["David Gemmell"],"pubdate":"2001-1-30","tags":[{"count":16,"name":"奇幻","title":"奇幻"},{"count":10,"name":"科幻世界译文版","title":"科幻世界译文版"},{"count":10,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":6,"name":"DavidGemmell","title":"DavidGemmell"},{"count":5,"name":"英国","title":"英国"},{"count":4,"name":"David_Gemmell","title":"David_Gemmell"},{"count":3,"name":"科幻世界•译文版","title":"科幻世界•译文版"},{"count":3,"name":"奇幻小说","title":"奇幻小说"}],"origin_title":"Sword in the Storm","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4587750.jpg","binding":"Mass Market Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"439","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4587750.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4587750.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4587750.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2717647\/","id":"2717647","publisher":"Del Rey","isbn10":"0345432347","isbn13":"9780345432346","title":"暴风雨之剑","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2717647","alt_title":"Sword in the Storm","author_intro":"","summary":"Fierce and proud, the Rigante dwell deep in the green mountain lands, worshiping the gods of air and water, and the spirits of the earth.

Carlin），「硬底子歷史」（Hardcore History）網站主持人\n幽默的筆法與說故事的本能，造就了鄧肯這位廣受歡迎的播客製作者。他以精采的方式回答了一個鮮少被提出的重要問題：是什麼削弱了羅馬共和國晚期的國力，以致於羅馬在凱撒的野心之下滅亡？這是貨真價實的歷史故事，機智、有說服力，並且揭露最終真相。──拉爾斯．布朗沃思（Lars Brownworth），「中古歐洲三部曲」作者\n從來沒有一本談論兩千年前歷史的書籍，出現得如此即時。鄧肯如敘事散文般的口吻，使他的播客節目觸動了世界各地愛好歷史人士；他訴說羅馬共和國衰敗的故事，書中每一頁都顯露出歷史故事與當代的關聯性。從煽動民粹主義的政客利用經濟與社會不平等的生動描述，到僵化的共和國政體適應環境改變的失敗，在《在風暴來臨之前》中都有生動的描述。正如同閱讀任何一份報紙，讀者也能在本書中看到我們今日面對的問題。──班傑明．衛慈（Benjamin Wittes），「洛菲爾」（Lawfare）部落格主編，美國布魯金斯學會（Brookings Institution）高級研究員\n麥克．鄧肯以他清晰而迷人的敘事才華，娓娓道出被低估的一段羅馬史：在凱撒崛起與誕生羅馬帝國的痛苦內戰之前，那段共和國最後的歲月。鄧肯機智與通順易讀的寫作風格，以及他著眼於生動的細節與難忘的軼事，將讀者帶入他引人入勝的故事中。──彼德．亞當森（Peter

That's taught as fact in psychology textbooks, academic journals, and bestselling books. And these hardwired differences explain everything from sexual orientation to gender identity, to why there aren't more women physicists or more stay-at-home dads. In this compelling book, Rebecca Jordan-Young takes on the evidence that sex differences are hardwired into the brain. Analyzing virtually all published research that supports the claims of 'human brain organization theory,' Jordan-Young reveals how often these studies fail the standards of science. Even if careful researchers point out the limits of their own studies, other researchers and journalists can easily ignore them because brain organization theory just sounds so right. But if a series of methodological weaknesses, questionable assumptions, inconsistent definitions, and enormous gaps between ambiguous findings and grand conclusions have accumulated through the years, then science isn't scientific at all. Elegantly written, this book argues passionately that the analysis of gender differences deserves far more rigorous, biologically sophisticated science. \"The evidence for hormonal sex differentiation of the human brain better resembles a hodge-podge pile than a solid structure...Once we have cleared the rubble, we can begin to build newer, more scientific stories about human development.\"","price":"USD 22.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":6,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Ernst Jünger"],"pubdate":"2004-5-4","tags":[{"count":5,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":4,"name":"德国","title":"德国"},{"count":4,"name":"Ernst_Jünger","title":"Ernst_Jünger"},{"count":2,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":2,"name":"文学","title":"文学"},{"count":2,"name":"德国文学","title":"德国文学"},{"count":2,"name":"一战","title":"一战"},{"count":1,"name":"汉斯","title":"汉斯"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3531042.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":["Michael Hofmann"],"catalog":"","pages":"320","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3531042.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3531042.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3531042.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1753314\/","id":"1753314","publisher":"Penguin Classics","isbn10":"0142437905","isbn13":"9780142437902","title":"Storm of Steel","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1753314","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"‘As though walking through a deep dream, I saw steel helmets approaching through the craters.

'Even military idiots find it difficult not to see some faults in his actions.'\nAndrew Roberts's previous book Masters and Commanders studied the creation of Allied grand strategy; Beating Corporal Hitler now analyses how Axis strategy evolved. Examining the Second World War on every front, Roberts asks whether, with a different decision-making process and a different strategy, the Axis might even have won. Were those German generals who blamed everything on Hitler after the war correct, or were they merely scapegoating their former F黨rer once he was safely beyond defending himself?\nIn researching this uniquely vivid history of the Second World War Roberts has walked many of the key battlefield and wartime sites of Russia, France, Italy, Germany and the Far East. The book is full of illuminating sidelights on the principle actors that bring their characters and the ways in which they reached decisions into fresh focus.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":17,"average":"9.7","min":0},"subtitle":"A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Three","author":["George R.

R. Martin's epic high fantasy series. In A Game of Thrones, an ancient kingdom was torn by the ambitions of ruthless men and women; in A Clash of Kings, war, sorcery, and madness swept over the kingdom like a voracious beast of prey. Now, as the brutal struggle for power nears its tumultuous climax, the battered and divided kingdom faces its most terrifying invasion--one that is being spearheaded from beyond the grave....\nA Storm Of Swords\nOf the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King's Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. Filled with the stench of death and decay from the destructive dynastic war, Daenerys is gathering allies and strength for an assault on King's Landing, hoping to win back the crown she believes is rightfully hers. But as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings bent on overwhelming the Seven Kingdoms arrives from the outermost lineof civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others--a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. And as the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest in the quest for victory until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords....Brilliantly conceived and grand in scope, A Storm of Swords is the incredible tale of a world of harsh beauty and powerful magic, torn by treachery, ravaged by brutality, and consumed by greed and ambition.

And mankind is not ready. The final volume of the Wheel of Time, \"A Memory of Light, \" was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson, \"New York Times\" bestselling author of the Mistborn books, was chosen by Jordan's editor---his wife, Harriet McDougal---to complete the final book. The scope and size of the volume was such that it could not be contained in a single book, and so Tor proudly presents \"The Gathering Storm\" as the first of three novels that will make up \"A Memory of Light.\" This short sequence will complete the struggle against the Shadow, bringing to a close a journey begun almost twenty years ago and marking the conclusion of the Wheel of Time, the preeminent fantasy epic of our era. In this epic novel, Robert Jordan's international bestselling series begins its dramatic conclusion. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward---wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders---his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself. Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower---and possibly the world itself. The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.","series":{"id":"26003","title":"The Wheel of Time"},"price":"$17.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Memoir of Ch'en Li-Fu, 1900-1993","author":["Lifu Chen, Sidney H.

Chen served as the private secretary and close confidant of Chiang Kaishek, president of the Republic of China, holding important official posts during the momentous years from 1926 to 1950. His recollection encompasses the titanic struggle between the Kuomintang (the Chinese National party) and the Chinese Communist party. To this day, no high-ranking member from either party has published memoirs of the period; and Chen thus provides invaluable portrayals of some of the personalities who shaped the destiny of modern China. In the early 1920s, Chen came to the United States to study mining engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. After gaining practical experience as a coal miner in Pittsburgh and Scranton, Chen returned to China. His uncle Ying-shih, a follower of Sun Yat-sen and military governor of Shanghai, had been a patron of the young Chiang Kai-shek, and his older brother, Kuo-fu, was then deeply involved in preparing for the forthcoming Nationalist Revolution; these connections gained Chen Li-fu a position as private secretary to Chiang. Chen's loyalty and outstanding abilities won Chiang's absolute trust. Over the following quarter century, Chen enjoyed considerable political influence as he advanced through several important official positions. In March 1926, after a communist plot to kill Chiang failed, Chen became an ardent anti-Communist. The memoir reveals that further attempts on Chiang's life convinced Chiang and his colleagues that the Communists had to be destroyed, a decision that launchedthe April 1927 purge of the Communists from the Kuomintang in which Chen played a major role. Chen's unique account presents new information about Chiang Kai-shek's arrest of Kuomintang veteran Hu Han-min in March 1931, an act which fatally split the Kuomintang and set the stage for a decline in the Kuomintang's prestige and authority and its loss of popular support. Chen also sheds new light on Wang Ching-wei's flight to Hanoi in 1938 and Li Tsung-jen and his Kwangsi clique's opposition to Chiang during the civil war from 1945 to 1949. Chen, who served Chiang Kai-shek loyally and capably, still believes that Chiang was the most suitable person to lead China in those stormy decades. He does not hesitate, however, to expose Chiang's character, his temper, or his ambition. With candor and clarity he describes the personality clashes, the internal power struggles, economic reforms, and difficulties in handling foreign affairs that ultimately led to the defeat of the Kuomintang and the ignominious retreat of the Nationalist government to Taiwan in 1949.","price":"GBP 19.63"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storm Thorgerson","Peter Curzon"],"pubdate":"2007-10-30","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"Storm_Thorgerson","title":"Storm_Thorgerson"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4180006.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"208","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4180006.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4180006.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4180006.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2515239\/","id":"2515239","publisher":"Vision On","isbn10":"1846096677","isbn13":"9781846096679","title":"Taken By Storm (Omnibus Press)","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2515239","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Thorgerson's prolific album art is presented in full-colour and includes in-depth analysis of each image including the themes and motivations that inspired the work as well as the practical details involved in producing each stunning image.

Teenage stowaway Jack Sparrow has assembled a motley crew, and theyre on the quest of a lifetime. Their goal: to locate and procure the legendary Sword of Corts, which will grant them unimaginable power. But will this ragtag team of adventurers survive their first mission, or will they succumb to the power of the sea, vicious pirates, and ancient curses? \n\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow is a series for young readers of nine to twelve years written by Rob Kidd. The series are prequels to the Pirates of the Caribbean films. The series details Jack Sparrow's teen years prior to the events of the movies.\n\n\nRelease Date: June 1, 2006 (USA) In the beginning Jack is in a Tortuga tavern, looking for his satchel, which has been stolen. He thinks he has found it under the seat of a notorious pirate Torrents, who catches Jack stealing. In the ensuing bar fight, Jack slips out, only to find out that the satchel isn't his. This one contains, among various personal items, the magical sheath for the Sword of Cortés. The bar attendant, Arabella, who pulled Jack out of the fight, makes this discovery with him. They plan together to a ship to go look for the storied Sword of Cortés, and reunite it with its sheath. Arabella directs Jack to an abandoned ship, the Barnacle. Before they leave Tortuga, a young boy, Fitzwilliam P. Dalton III, insists on joining them for their quest. The three sail for many days and come upon an island, where they meet two thirteen year old boys, Jean and Tumen, and their cat sister Constance. Jack remarks about The Sword of Cortés, and Jean and Tumen lead the crew to a 'dead' city on the cursed island. Inside the main building of the city, the crew find the skeleton of the city's king, Stone-Eyed Sam, who is said to be holding the Sword, but it is missing. Jack pockets the fabled stone eye of the now-dead former pirate king as a souvenir. The crew find left footprints on the ground, and soon realize that the notorious pirate, Left Foot Louis, has it. They all go rushing to the Barnacle, when they suddenly come face to face with Torrents, a crew member of the feared Davy Jones's crew. They all battle on the beach, for who would get the Sword of Cortés's sheath, and Jack eventually defeats Torrents (look out for a reference to Ben Franklin!) and escape on the Barnacle.\n\nIt is revealed in this book that Jack knew Benjamin Franklin, and taught him the secrets of electricity.\n\n  \nlength: (cm)18.9    　　　            　　　　　            　　　　　 width:(cm)14.5","price":"42.42"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Images of Pink Floyd","author":["Storm Thorgerson","Peter Curzon"],"pubdate":"2003-03-03","tags":[{"count":4,"name":"Storm_Thorgerson","title":"Storm_Thorgerson"},{"count":1,"name":"音乐","title":"音乐"},{"count":1,"name":"设计","title":"设计"},{"count":1,"name":"装帧与设计","title":"装帧与设计"},{"count":1,"name":"艺术与音乐","title":"艺术与音乐"},{"count":1,"name":"*灵光","title":"*灵光"},{"count":1,"name":"*弦外","title":"*弦外"},{"count":1,"name":"(English)","title":"(English)"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1648354.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"192","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s1648354.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s1648354.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1648354.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1777240\/","id":"1777240","publisher":"Sanctuary Publishing, Ltd.","isbn10":"1860748333","isbn13":"9781860748332","title":"Mind over Matter","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1777240","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Contains exclusive stories behind the images of nearly all of Pink Floyd's albums including A Saucerful of Secrets, Atom Heart Mother, The Dark Side  of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Division Bell amongst  others.

Formed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell in London in 1968 (with the addition of Throbbing Gristle's Peter Christopherson in 1974), Hipgnosis specialized in creative photography for the music business, making classic album covers for bands and musicians like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Electric Light Orchestra, Genesis, 10cc, Yes, Peter Gabriel, The Gods, Black Sabbath, Rainbow, Paul McCartney, Syd Barrett, Scorpions and Styx, among others. Over the course of its 15 year existence, Hipgnosis produced timeless rock iconography--everybody knows at least one Hipgnosis cover, thanks to Pink Floyd's \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" The firm's inventive takes on the themes or titles of any given album opened up a new visual language in album cover art, one in which theatrical tableaux, trick photography and logo design played notable roles. \"For the Love of Vinyl\" is the first book to survey Storm and Powell's output in detail, focusing on more than 60 package designs--from cover to label--described with entertaining detail by the team who created them. Also included are short essays by musicians (such as Pink Floyd's Nick Mason and artists (British Pop artist Peter Blake) and fellow designers (Paula Scher) on their favorite Hipgnosis covers, as well as previously unseen photographs and ephemera. Complementing all this material is a lengthy critical-historical text examining Hipgnosis and its legacy. \"For the Love of Vinyl\" is \"the\" rock book of 2008.

In den dän.-dt. Auseinandersetzungen 1848–52 engagierte er sich publizistisch und dichterisch und verlor 1852 wegen seiner antidän. Betätigung seine Zulassung als Anwalt. 1853 trat er als Assessor in den preußischen Staatsdienst ein und zog nach Potsdam; von hier aus hatte er Kontakt zu dem literarischen Verein »Tunnel über der Spree« in Berlin (Th. Fontane, P. Heyse, mit dem sich eine Freundschaft entwickelte, u. a.). 1856 wurde er Kreisrichter in Heiligenstadt. Nach der dän. Niederlage 1864 kehrte S. als Landvogt nach Husum zurück. 1867–80 war er Amtsrichter im preußischen Schleswig; ein Jahr nach der Pensionierung zog er nach Hademarschen. S. selbst stellte die Lyrik immer an die erste Stelle seines Schaffens und behauptete, auch seine Novellistik sei aus seiner Lyrik erwachsen. Sein lyrisches Werk ist durch die Beschränkung auf das Private und Individuelle gekennzeichnet, mit der Absicht, darin »das möglichst Allgemeine« auszusagen: »Gelegenheitsgedicht im höhern Sinne.« Das Lyrische versteht er als »Naturlaut der Seele«, wobei sich aus der lyrischen Empﬁndung die Form von selbst ergebe. Schwerpunkte bilden Naturgedichte, bei denen Stimmungen der Einsamkeit und der Trauer dominieren, und Liebesgedichte, in denen sich die Evokation von Liebe und tabuloser Leidenschaft kontrapunktisch mit Gedanken an Vergänglichkeit, Abschied und Tod verbindet. Als Stimmungsbilder und aus der Gelegenheit hervorgehende Schöpfungen erscheinen auch viele seiner (insgesamt mehr als 50) Novellen, die in der Regel zuerst in Zeitschriften erschienen. Sie sind meist nicht von der Formstrenge bestimmt, die S.s eigene Charakterisierung der Novelle als Schwester des Dramas nahelegt. Es herrschen vielmehr atmosphärische, landschaftliche, von Erinnerungen stimmungshaft geprägte Elemente vor, die wiederum auf die Erfahrung der Vergänglichkeit verweisen. Von der Stimmungskunst früher Novellen wie Immensee entwickelt sich S.s Novellistik in zwei Richtungen: einerseits zur Einbeziehung sozialer Fragen, psychologischer Konﬂikte und aktueller Themen (Vererbung, Kriminalität u. a.), andererseits zur historischen Novelle, die durch die Art der erzählerisch komplexen Annäherung die ›Wahrheit‹ des vergangenen Geschehens in Frage stellt und zugleich Vergangenheit und Gegenwart verbindet (Aquis submersus, Der Schimmelreiter u. a.).","summary":"","price":"2,10 EUR"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":5,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Bucquoye, Moniek E","Storm, Dieter Van Den"],"pubdate":"2008\/05\/01","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"设计","title":"设计"},{"count":1,"name":"inds","title":"inds"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3235139.jpg","binding":"精裝","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"156","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3235139.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3235139.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3235139.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3193167\/","id":"3193167","publisher":"PAGE ONE PUBLISHING PTE LTD","isbn10":"9812457038","isbn13":"9789812457035","title":"FORMS WITH A SMILE","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3193167","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"每當提到「超現實主義」(surrealism ) 時，大部份所聯想到的都是一種文學或藝術風格，但事實上，超現實主義在其它領域的影響力也是不容忽視的。在當代的設計領域中，我們經常也可以發現超現實主義的蹤跡，以一種獨有的幽默形式出現。\n本書收錄現代的超現實主義藝術家作品，這些超乎我們想像的作品包括：長毛地毯、在牛奶瓶裡的燈、木枝形狀的 USB 隨身碟、用絨毛玩具做成的椅字…等等。如果要說這些作品很幽默，還不如說它們帶有一種傳染性：會讓人看了之後會忍不住微笑。\n超現實主義的設計並不只是我們想像中的設計作品那麼簡單，設計師在他們的作品中都加入了某些詼諧而帶有微妙諷刺性的「意見」，他們用作品向世界大聲吶喊：誰說一定要凡事都那麼認真呢？","price":"280.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":5,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"台版译作《阳性反应》","author":["Paul Russell"],"pubdate":"2000-9-9","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":2,"name":"LGBT","title":"LGBT"},{"count":1,"name":"黑色幽默","title":"黑色幽默"},{"count":1,"name":"青春","title":"青春"},{"count":1,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":1,"name":"教育学","title":"教育学"},{"count":1,"name":"人类学","title":"人类学"},{"count":1,"name":"PaulRussell","title":"PaulRussell"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2717727.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"371","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s2717727.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s2717727.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2717727.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2264544\/","id":"2264544","publisher":"Stonewall Inn Editions","isbn10":"0312263031","isbn13":"9780312263034","title":"The Coming Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2264544","alt_title":"","author_intro":"保羅．羅素（Paul Russell）2000年的得獎（Ferro-Grumley Award之Fiction类）作品。Triangle Awards是由Publishing Triangle和The Robert Chesley Foundation共同舉辦的文學獎，每年在春天公佈並頒獎給當年度同志相關的小說、非小說和詩集...等類別，而The Ferro-Grumley Awards則是其中一項，頒給年度最佳男、女同志小說（recognize excellence and experiment in literary fiction）。\n作品简介：\n校規嚴謹的著名貴族中學來了一位新老師──崔西。他年輕而熱情，活力十足且不拘小節，甚至有點不修邊幅。然而謹言慎行的拘謹校長路易士卻對他眷顧有加。崔西是個素食主義者，但他對年輕美好的同性肉體卻有無法饜足的渴求。帶著可能被舊日親密愛侶傳染愛滋的恐懼，他離開紐約這顆大蘋果，在校園中扮演形象良好的聖者，跟保守的福克中學一樣壓抑而自制。然而，在學生諾亞的主動與大膽告白下，他們突破同性與師生的禁忌。在夏日裡曖?滋生的不倫之戀，逐漸成長而終將無法遮掩。在冬日鋪天蓋地的暴風雪中，福克中學也正蘊釀一場醜聞風暴。福克中學的永久典範──死去的老校長艾米瑞奇，終其一身隱藏自己；一板一眼的現任校長路易士將熱情投注在教育與音樂。走過風暴，崔西與諾亞又做出怎樣驚人的抉擇。","summary":"Set against the backdrop of a traditional boys' school in upstate New York, \"The Coming Storm\" is a delicately and brilliantly rendered tale that reveals the most closely held secrets of the human heart.

Artists, architects, poets, inventors, scientists, and others all navigate the same stages of the process in order to discover something that does not yet exist. All of us must work our way through the empty page, the blank screen, writer’s block, confusion, chaos, and doubt. In this book, Leski draws from her observations and experiences as a teacher, student, maker, writer, and architect to describe the workings of the creative process.\nLeski sees the creative process as being like a storm; it slowly begins to gather and take form until it overtakes us—if we are willing to let it. It is dynamic, continually in motion; it starts, stops, rages and abates, ebbs and flows. In illustrations that accompany each chapter, she maps the arc of the creative process by tracing the path of water droplets traveling the stages of a storm.\nLeski describes unlearning, ridding ourselves of preconceptions; only when we realize what we don’t know can we pose the problem that we need to solve. We gather evidence—with notebook jottings, research, the collection of objects—propelling the process. We perceive and conceive; we look ahead without knowing where we are going; we make connections. We pause, retreat, and stop, only to start again. To illustrate these stages of the process, Leski draws on examples of creative practice that range from Paul Klee to Steve Jobs, from the discovery of continental drift to the design of Antoni Gaudí’s Sagrada Familia.\nCreativity, Leski tells us, is a path with no beginning or end; it is ongoing. This revelatory view of the creative process will be an essential guide for anyone engaged in creative discovery.","price":"USD 24.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":9,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Lincoln Child"],"pubdate":"2008-2-26","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"科幻","title":"科幻"},{"count":2,"name":"海洋","title":"海洋"},{"count":2,"name":"悬疑小说","title":"悬疑小说"},{"count":2,"name":"Lincoln_Child","title":"Lincoln_Child"},{"count":1,"name":"译林杂志","title":"译林杂志"},{"count":1,"name":"航海","title":"航海"},{"count":1,"name":"欧美惊悚悬疑","title":"欧美惊悚悬疑"},{"count":1,"name":"文学","title":"文学"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4666477.jpg","binding":"Mass Market Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"432","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4666477.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4666477.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4666477.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3506655\/","id":"3506655","publisher":"Anchor","isbn10":"1400095476","isbn13":"9781400095476","title":"Deep Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3506655","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"In this explosive new thriller, one of the most incredible and frightening discoveries mankind has ever faced is about to surface.\n\nOn an oil platform in the middle of the North Atlantic, a terrifying series of illnesses is spreading through the crew.

Although Dobrowner's work is widely exhibited, collected and published in periodicals, this is the first book featuring his storm photographs.","summary":"Mitch Dobrowner has been chasing storms since 2009, traveling throughout Western and Midwestern America to capture nature in its full fury. Making photographs in the tradition of Ansel Adams, to the highest standard of craftsmanship, Dobrowner creates extraordinary black-and-white images of monsoons, tornados and massive thunderstorms conjure awe and wonder. As Dobrowner states in the book's afterword, \"I experience storms as living beings, organic things, both rational and unpredictable in the way they look, how they move, grow and die.

In \"Storms of My Grandchildren,\" Dr. James Hansen--the nation's leading scientist on climate issues--speaks out for the first time with the full truth about global warming: The planet is hurtling even more rapidly than previously acknowledged to a climatic point of no return. Although the threat of human-caused climate change is now widely recognized, politicians have failed to connect policy with the science, responding instead with ineffectual remedies dictated by special interests. Hansen shows why President Obama's solution, cap-and-trade, which Al Gore has signed on to, won't work; why we must phase out all coal, and why 350 ppm of carbon dioxide is a goal we must achieve if our children and grandchildren are to avoid global meltdown and the storms of the book's title. This urgent manifesto bucks conventional wisdom (including the Kyoto Protocol) and is sure to stir controversy, but Hansen--whose climate predictions have come to pass again and again, beginning in the 1980s when he first warned Congress about global warming--is the single most credible voice on the subject worldwide. Hansen paints a devastating but all-too-realistic picture of what will happen in the near future, mere years and decades from now, if we follow the course we're on. But he is also an optimist, showing that there is still time to do what we need to save the planet. Urgent, strong action is needed, and this book, released to coincide with the Copenhagen Conference in December 2009, will be key in setting the agenda going forward to create a groundswell, a tipping point, to save humanity--and our grandchildren--from a dire fate more imminent than we had supposed.

Martin sold his first story in 1971 and has been writing professionally ever since. He has written fantasy, horror, and science fiction, and for his sins spent ten years in Hollywood as a writer\/producer, working on Twilight Zone, Beauty and the Beast, and various feature films and television pilots that were never made. In the mid 90s he returned to prose, his first love, and began work on his epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire. He has been in the Seven Kingdoms ever since. Whenever he's allowed to leave, he returns to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he lives with the lovely Parris, a big white dog called Mischa, and two cats named Augustus and Caligula who think they run the place.\nBiography\nAs a child growing up in New Jersey, George R.R. Martin displayed an early interest in \"the writing life\" by selling monster stories of his own invention to the children in his Bayonne neighborhood. In high school he became an avid comic book collector and began to write for comic fanzines. He sold his first story to Galaxy in 1970 when he was 21 years old.\nMartin received his bachelor's and master's degrees in journalism from Northwestern University. After graduation he served two years in VISTA, then worked as a teacher and chess tournament director in the Midwest, while continuing to craft award-winning short fiction. His first full-length novel, Dying of the Light, was published in 1977. A dark, lyrical sci-fi tone poem set on a doomed world without a sun, the book was nominated for a Hugo Award.\nThroughout the 1980s, Martin worked in television, writing for science fiction- and fantasy-themed shows like The Twilight Zone and Beauty and the Beast. At this time he became involved with Wild Cards, a long-running anthology series composed of \"mosaic stories\" written by multiple authors and set in a shared universe. In addition to editing the series, Martin has contributed stories to the Wild Card books.\nIn 1996, Martin published A Game of Thrones, the first installment of his magnum opus, the epic fantasy series A Song of Fire and Ice. Set in the Seven Kingdoms, a realm resembling medieval Europe, the internationally bestselling series has provided the ultimate showcase for Martin's formidable world-building and characterization skills.\nDuring the course of his long, prolific career, Martin has accrued every major literary prize for science fiction or fantasy writing, including the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Bram Stoker, Daedelus, and Locus awards. But what endears him especially to his readers is his extraordinary accessibility. A tireless participant in genre conventions and festivals, he maintains a cordial relationship with his fans through his website and blog. He is also a member of the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America.","summary":"Here is the third volume in George R. R. Martin's magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R. R. Martin's stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.\nA Storm of Swords\nOf the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King's Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world....\nBut as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others--a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the SevenKingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords. . .","price":"USD 9.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Ernst Junger"],"pubdate":"2004-8-3","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"军事","title":"军事"},{"count":3,"name":"一战","title":"一战"},{"count":2,"name":"英语","title":"英语"},{"count":2,"name":"EnstJunger","title":"EnstJunger"},{"count":1,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"Penguin","title":"Penguin"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28644631.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"320","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s28644631.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s28644631.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28644631.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3547602\/","id":"3547602","publisher":"Penguin Classic","isbn10":"0141186917","isbn13":"9780141186917","title":"STORM OF STEEL","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3547602","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Ernst Jünger (1895-1998) the son of a wealthy chemist, ran away from home to join the Foreign Legion. His father dragged him back, but he returned to military service when he joined the German army on the outbreak of the First World War. Storm of Steel (Stahlgewittern) was Jünger's first book, published in 1920. Greatly admired by the Nazis, Jünger remained at a distance from the regime, with books such as his allegorical work On the Marble Cliffs (1939) functioning as a covert criticism of Nazi ideology and methods.","summary":"Presenting the desperate conflict of the First World War through the eyes of an ordinary German soldier, Ernst Jünger's Storm of Steel is translated by Michael Hofmann in Penguin Modern Classics.\n'As though walking through a deep dream, I saw steel helmets approaching through the craters. They seemed to sprout from the fire-harrowed soil like some iron harvest.'\nA memoir of astonishing power, savagery and ashen lyricism, Storm of Steel depicts Ernst Jünger's experience of combat on the front line - leading raiding parties, defending trenches against murderous British incursions, and simply enduring as shells tore his comrades apart. One of the greatest books to emerge from the catastrophe of the First World War, it illuminates like no other book not only the horrors but also the fascination of a war that made men keep fighting for four long years.","price":"USD 22.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":9,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["B’s‐LOG COLLECTION"],"pubdate":"2010年9月17日","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"—原画集と公式书と资料设定集—","title":"—原画集と公式书と资料设定集—"},{"count":2,"name":"画集","title":"画集"},{"count":2,"name":"公式书","title":"公式书"},{"count":1,"name":"菊家","title":"菊家"},{"count":1,"name":"畫集","title":"畫集"},{"count":1,"name":"待入荷","title":"待入荷"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6420364.jpg","binding":"大型本","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"167","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6420364.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6420364.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6420364.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5299393\/","id":"5299393","publisher":"エンターブレイン","isbn10":"4047268038","isbn13":"9784047268036","title":"STORM LOVER 公式ビジュアルファンブック","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5299393","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"恋は付き合ってからが本番!!!\n素敵な彼氏との甘い学園生活を送れる『STORM LOVER』待望のファンブックが登場!!　告白あり、バカップルあり、倦怠期ありのリアルな恋愛模様を余すことなく楽しめる恋の指南をバッチリサポートしちゃいます☆　スペシャル企画としてキャストの羽多野渉さん、寺島拓篤さんの対談、梶裕貴さん、三浦祥朗さん、浪川大輔さんの鼎談、宮野真守さんの単独インタビューと見どころ読みどころ満載です!!　また原画家の川人やすたけさんによる描き下ろしイラストや開発者インタビューも掲載！　さらに声優陣のサイン入りポラロイドを抽選で10名にプレゼント!!　お見逃しなく♪\n美麗CGを完全収録したCGギャラリー、データリスト完備の攻略情報、開発者鼎談インタビューなど見どころ満載の公式ビジュアルファンブック。","price":" 2,940"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":7,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A True Story of Men Against the Sea","author":["Sebastian Junger"],"pubdate":"1998-07-01","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":1,"name":"纪实文学","title":"纪实文学"},{"count":1,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"to","title":"to"},{"count":1,"name":"really","title":"really"},{"count":1,"name":"read","title":"read"},{"count":1,"name":"good","title":"good"},{"count":1,"name":"but","title":"but"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1557320.jpg","binding":"Mass Market Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"320","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s1557320.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s1557320.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1557320.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1754013\/","id":"1754013","publisher":"HarperTorch","isbn10":"006101351X","isbn13":"9780061013515","title":"The Perfect Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1754013","alt_title":"完美风暴","author_intro":"","summary":"\n\nOctober 1991.

Wolfe was the recipient of a Fulbright fellowship in 1997 and was awarded the National Institutes of Health (NIH) International Research Scientist Development Award in 1999 and the prestigious NIH Director's Pioneer Award in 2005.","summary":"In The Viral Storm, award-winning biologist Nathan Wolfe tells the story of how viruses and human beings have evolved side by side through history; how deadly viruses like HIV, swine flu, and bird flu almost wiped us out in the past; and why modern life has made our species vulnerable to the threat of a global pandemic.Wolfe's research missions to the jungles of Africa and the rain forests of Borneo have earned him the nickname \"the Indiana Jones of virus hunters,\" and here Wolfe takes listeners along on his groundbreaking and often dangerous research trips-to reveal the surprising origins of the most deadly diseases and to explain the role that viruses have played in human evolution.In a world where each new outbreak seems worse than the one before, Wolfe points the way forward, as new technologies are brought to bear in the most remote areas of the world to neutralize these viruses and even harness their power for the good of humanity.

But is it the greatest archaeological find in history—or the most terrifying?\n \n\nFormer naval doctor Peter Crane is urgently summoned to a remote oil platform in the North Atlantic to help diagnose a bizarre medical condition spreading through the rig. But when he arrives, Crane learns that the real trouble lies far below—on “Deep Storm,” a stunningly advanced science research facility built two miles beneath the surface on the ocean floor. The topsecret structure has been designed for one purpose: to excavate a recently discovered undersea site that may hold the answers to a mystery steeped in centuries of myth and speculation. \n\nSworn to secrecy, Dr. Crane descends to Deep Storm. A year earlier, he is told, routine drilling uncovered the remains of mankind’s most sophisticated ancient civilization: the legendary Atlantis. But now that the site is being excavated, a series of disturbing illnesses has begun to affect the operation. Scientists and technicians are experiencing a bizarre array of symptoms—from simple fatigue to violent psychotic episodes. As Crane is indoctrinated into the strange world of Deep Storm and commences his investigation, he begins to suspect that the covert facility conceals something more complicated than a medical mystery.The discovery of Atlantis might, in fact, be a cover for something far more sinister . . . and deadly. \n\nLike Lincoln Child’s spectacular bestsellers coauthored with Douglas Preston ( The Book of the   Dead ,  Relic ),  Deep Storm  melds scientific detail and gripping adventure in a superbly imagined, chillingly real journey into unknown territory. Child is a master of suspense, and  Deep Storm  is his most ambitious novel to date.","price":"CDN$ 34.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Story of Real Madrid (Mainstream Sport)","author":["Phil Ball"],"pubdate":"2003-09-01","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"皇家马德里","title":"皇家马德里"},{"count":1,"name":"足球","title":"足球"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4182018.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"224","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4182018.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4182018.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4182018.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1851116\/","id":"1851116","publisher":"Mainstream Publishing","isbn10":"1840187638","isbn13":"9781840187632","title":"White Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1851116","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Within the trophy room at the Bernabeu, the spoils of a century's achievements provide indisputable evidence of football's conquistadores rubbing the world's noses in the dirt.

But once the first daring mariners successfully navigated to far shores—whether it was the Vikings, the Irish, the Chinese, Christopher Columbus in the north, or the Portuguese and the Spanish in the south—the Atlantic evolved in the world's growing consciousness of itself as an enclosed body of water bounded by the Americas to the West, and by Europe and Africa to the East. Atlantic is a biography of this immense space, of a sea which has defined and determined so much about the lives of the millions who live beside or near its tens of thousands of miles of coast.\n.\nThe Atlantic has been central to the ambitions of explorers, scientists and warriors, and it continues to affect our character, attitudes, and dreams. Poets to potentates, seers to sailors, fishermen to foresters—all have a relationship with this great body of blue-green sea and regard her as friend or foe, adversary or ally, depending on circumstance or fortune. Simon Winchester chronicles that relationship, making the Atlantic come vividly alive. Spanning from the earth's geological origins to the age of exploration, World War II battles to modern pollution, his narrative is epic and awe-inspiring.\n.\nThe definitive biography of the world's most important body of water -- the Atlantic. One hundred and ninety million years ago, the sh ifting of two of the world's tectonic plates led to the creation of an immense chasm. This giant gash in the flanks of the planet slowly opened up and eventually evolved into the most important and most travelled ocean in our world. In this utterly original biography, Simon Winchester explores the life of the Atlantic; it's birth, its relationship with mankind, and what lies in store for it once man has left the stage. He charts the development of the first settlements by the Oceanside -- the communities of Celts and Vikings and whose lives depended on the sea -- and delves into the age of exploration, venturing to forgotten worlds. The building of some of the world's most beautiful port cities -- London, Rio de Janeiro, New York, Casablanca -- is also examined, along with the creation of settlements and colonies in and around the sea. Completely unique and highly readable, Atlantic takes its reader on a wonderful journey through time, along the waves of our planet's most significant ocean.\n.\n【From Publishers Weekly】\n.\nWinchester, bestselling author of The Professor and the Madman, returns to the natural world with his epic new book, a \"biography\" of the Atlantic Ocean, from its origins 370 million years ago through the population of its shores by humanity and their interactions with it. He sees the Atlantic as the vital ingredient in the blooming of Western civilization. He scrutinizes the early explorations from the Vikings and Norsemen through Columbus, detailing the perils of the open sea. With his excellent research and engrossing anecdotes about the ocean as \"a living thing,\" Winchester spotlights its inspiration on poets, painters, and writers in its majestic beauty. Although he does not neglect the chief tragedies of the Atlantic, like the slave trade and the maritime battles, Winchester occasionally flits beelike from scene to scene, and the facts become lost in a blur. Maybe this is the price for such a monumental undertaking. Nevertheless, Winchester's sea saga is necessary reading for those who want to understand the planet better, even as, he notes, our waters are rapidly changing from pollution, overfishing, and climate change. 44 b&w illus.; 4 maps.

All rights reserved.\n.\n【From Booklist】\n.\nOf all of Winchester’s amazingly educational and entertaining books, a list that includes the best-selling The Map That Changed the World (2001) and Krakatoa (2003), his latest one is perhaps the most unique and the most creative in its approach. It is presented as a biography—of an ocean! It is as if he is telling the life story of the Atlantic, and, indeed, as we learn from one of the most wondrous facts presented here, oceans actually do have life spans—they have “their beginnings and their endings.” The Atlantic, as we are told, was born 10 million years ago by the continental split between Africa and South America, and its death will occur some 170 million years from now. The geological history of this vast body of water is partnered with the human story of habitation around it, and travel over it, because in Winchester’s view, the Atlantic has functioned as the “inland sea of Western civilization.” His coverage of aspects of human involvement with this ocean is lively and extensive, with topics ranging from the Atlantic as represented in the arts to the effects of climate change and overfishing and from immigration patterns to the use of the ocean’s waters for warfare. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Winchester’s latest is bound to follow his previous books onto best-seller lists, and this one should be promoted as one of his best.\n--Brad Hooper\n.\n【Review】\n.\n“Winchester brings a knowledge as vast and deep as his subject to this history of the Atlantic Ocean.”\n--Entertainment Weekly","ebook_price":"99.79","price":"USD 27.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Freely, John"],"pubdate":"","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"英文版","title":"英文版"},{"count":2,"name":"历史","title":"历史"},{"count":2,"name":"军事","title":"军事"},{"count":1,"name":"草原民族","title":"草原民族"},{"count":1,"name":"突厥","title":"突厥"},{"count":1,"name":"战争史","title":"战争史"},{"count":1,"name":"军事史","title":"军事史"},{"count":1,"name":"中世纪","title":"中世纪"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6833556.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"304","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6833556.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6833556.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6833556.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4678173\/","id":"4678173","publisher":"","isbn10":"1845117034","isbn13":"9781845117030","title":"Storm on Horseback-The Seljuk Warriors of Turkey","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4678173","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"325.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A New History of the Second World War","author":["Andrew Roberts"],"pubdate":"2010-5-25","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"歷史","title":"歷史"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4765575.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"792","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4765575.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4765575.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4765575.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5252897\/","id":"5252897","publisher":"Penguin UK","isbn10":"0141029285","isbn13":"9780141029283","title":"The Storm of War","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5252897","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Andrew Roberts is a biographer and historian of international renown whose books include Salisbury: Victorian Titan (winner, the Wolfson Prize for History); Masters and Commanders; and The Storm of War, which reached No. 2 on the Sunday Times bestseller list. His most recent book was Napoleon the Great (2014), which won the Grand Prix of the Fondation Napoléon. Roberts is a Fellow of the Royal Societies of Literature and Arts. He appears regularly on British television and radio and writes for the Sunday Telegraph, Spectator, Literary Review, Mail on Sunday and Daily Telegraph.","summary":"On 2 August 1944, Winston Churchill mocked Adolf Hitler in the House of Commons by the rank he had reached in the First World War. 'Russian success has been somewhat aided by the strategy of Herr Hitler, of Corporal Hitler', Churchill jibed. 'Even military idiots find it difficult not to see some faults in his actions'. Andrew Roberts' previous book \"Masters and Commanders\" studied the creation of Allied grand strategy; \"The Storm of War\" now analyzes how Axis strategy evolved. Examining the Second World War on every front, Roberts asks whether, with a different decision-making process and a different strategy, the Axis might even have won. Were those German generals who blamed everything on Hitler after the war correct, or were they merely scapegoating their former Fuhrer once he was safely beyond defending himself? The book is full of illuminating sidelights on the principle actors that bring their characters and the ways in which they reached decisions into fresh focus.","price":"USD 28.75"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Dirk Pitt Adventure","author":["Clive Cussler","Dirk Cussler"],"pubdate":"2014-10-28","tags":[],"origin_title":"Havana Storm","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29960862.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"464","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29960862.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29960862.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29960862.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/26272184\/","id":"26272184","publisher":"G.P.

Meanwhile, Pitt’s children, marine engineer Dirk and oceanographer Summer, are on an investigation of their own, chasing an Aztec stone that may reveal the whereabouts of a vast historical Aztec treasure. The problem is, that stone was believed to have been destroyed on the battleship Maine in Havana Harbor in 1898, which brings them both to Cuba as well—and squarely into harm’s way. The three of them have been in desperate situations before . . . but perhaps never quite as dire as the one facing them now.","price":"GBP 22.91"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Critical Overview (Literary Criticism in Perspective)","author":["Wiebke Strehl"],"pubdate":"2000-06-24","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"文学","title":"文学"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1680535.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"257","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s1680535.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s1680535.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1680535.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1811757\/","id":"1811757","publisher":"Camden House","isbn10":"1571130454","isbn13":"9781571130457","title":"Theodor Storm's Immensee","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1811757","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Theodor Storm (1817-88), one of the leading literary Realists of the nineteenth century, achieved world-wide popularity with the novella Immensee\/ in 1849. The work, which Storm himself referred to as a 'Perle deutscher Poesie' (pearl of German poetry) reached over thirty editions and was translated into 17 languages by the time of the author's death. But in addition to being called a masterpiece by such leading literary lights of the day as Theodor Fontane and Paul Heyse, Immensee also attracted its share of criticism from the first, for instance as a mere sentimental love story. Then in the 1930s and forties Storm's novella was seized upon by right-wing critics as appropriate National Socialist reading material, which had the effect of sullying its reputation somewhat long after 1945. Since the 1960s Immensee's critical reputation has been rehabilitated and both novella and Storm himself analyzed from a variety of viewpoints, including Marxism and democratic humanitarianism. Strehl's book chronicles the highlights of this critical history.Wiebke Strehl is assistant professor of German at the University of South Carolina.","price":"USD 60.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":5,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Cressida Cowell"],"pubdate":"2010-4-15","tags":[{"count":4,"name":"DavidTennant","title":"DavidTennant"},{"count":3,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":2,"name":"有声书","title":"有声书"},{"count":2,"name":"儿童文学","title":"儿童文学"},{"count":1,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"冒险","title":"冒险"},{"count":1,"name":"audiobook","title":"audiobook"},{"count":1,"name":"CressidaCowell","title":"CressidaCowell"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7660798.jpg","binding":"Audio CD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7660798.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7660798.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7660798.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10482003\/","id":"10482003","publisher":"Hodder Children's Books","isbn10":"1844569810","isbn13":"9781844569816","title":"How to Ride a Dragon's Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10482003","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP 13.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":4,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Clancy, Tom"],"pubdate":"1998-2","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"英文小说","title":"英文小说"},{"count":1,"name":"技术惊悚","title":"技术惊悚"},{"count":1,"name":"小說","title":"小說"},{"count":1,"name":"sci-fi","title":"sci-fi"},{"count":1,"name":"TomClancy","title":"TomClancy"},{"count":1,"name":"Techno-thriller","title":"Techno-thriller"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4759360.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"832","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4759360.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4759360.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4759360.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6052706\/","id":"6052706","publisher":"","isbn10":"0006173624","isbn13":"9780006173625","title":"Red Storm Rising","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6052706","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Tom Clancy's second classic No 1 bestselling thriller -- a chillingly authentic vision of modern war -- now reissued in a new cover.

Jason Ā. Josephson-Storm argues that as broad cultural history goes, this narrative is wrong, as attempts to suppress magic have failed more often than they have succeeded. Even the human sciences have been more enchanted than is commonly supposed. But that raises the question: How did a magical, spiritualist, mesmerized Europe ever convince itself that it was disenchanted?\nJosephson-Storm traces the history of the myth of disenchantment in the births of philosophy, anthropology, sociology, folklore, psychoanalysis, and religious studies. Ironically, the myth of mythless modernity formed at the very time that Britain, France, and Germany were in the midst of occult and spiritualist revivals. Indeed, Josephson-Storm argues, these disciplines' founding figures were not only aware of, but profoundly enmeshed in, the occult milieu; and it was specifically in response to this burgeoning culture of spirits and magic that they produced notions of a disenchanted world.\nBy providing a novel history of the human sciences and their connection to esotericism, The Myth of Disenchantment dispatches with most widely held accounts of modernity and its break from the premodern past.","price":"USD 32.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Aftermath of Slavery","author":["Leon F.

How will Social Security and Medicare function with fewer working taxpayers to support these programs? According to Laurence Kotlikoff and Scott Burns, if our government continues on the course it has set, we'll see skyrocketing tax rates, drastically lower retirement and health benefits, high inflation, a rapidly depreciating dollar, unemployment, and political instability. The government has lost its compass, say Kotlikoff and Burns, and the Bush administration's spending and tax policies have charted a course straight into the coming generational storm.\n \n Kotlikoff and Burns take us on a guided tour of our generational imbalance: There's the \"fiscal child abuse\" that will double the taxes paid by the next generation. There's also the \"deficit delusion\" of the under-reported national debt. And none of this, they say, will be solved by any of the popularly touted remedies: cutting taxes, technological progress, immigration, foreign investment, or the elimination of wasteful government spending. Kotlikoff and Burns propose bold new policies, including meaningful reforms of Social Security and Medicare, that are simple, straightforward, and geared to attract support from both political parties.","price":"USD 18.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Jeff Soto"],"pubdate":"2008","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"致敬...","title":"致敬..."}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3362373.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3362373.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3362373.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3362373.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3297667\/","id":"3297667","publisher":"Mark Murphy Designs","isbn10":"0977143082","isbn13":"9780977143085","title":"Jeff Soto Storm Clouds","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3297667","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Martin, George R.R."],"pubdate":"2012-3","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"奇幻","title":"奇幻"},{"count":1,"name":"英语","title":"英语"},{"count":1,"name":"有声书","title":"有声书"},{"count":1,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"冰与火之歌","title":"冰与火之歌"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7089897.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7089897.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7089897.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7089897.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10433294\/","id":"10433294","publisher":"","isbn10":"0449011909","isbn13":"9780449011904","title":"A Storm of Swords","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10433294","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"THE BOOK BEHIND THE THIRD SEASON OF GAME OF THRONES,AN ORIGINAL SERIES NOW ON HBO. \n \nHere is the third volume in George R.

Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King’s Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. . . .\n\nBut as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others—a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable.

His body of theoretical work focuses on buildings of crisis, whether marred by major earthquakes, suffering the effects of economic embargo, or damaged by war. Since the destruction of the World Trade Center, his designs have taken on new meaning and significance. In \"The Storm and the Fall,\" Woods brings his visions to a new depth, moving them from feverishly rendered drawings to three-dimensional space. The book focuses on two recent Woods installations - one at the Houghton Gallery at New York's Cooper Union, the other at the Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain, Paris - that address the role of today's architecture. The Storm critiques the geometric box that rules most building designs and proposes instead a dynamic field of potential energy, represented by a complex array of vectors. The Fall crystallizes a built space in the midst of collapse, witnessing a moment too brief to inhabit - except in imagination. Both pieces are explored in Woods's powerful sketches, renderings, models, and constructions, exposing the mutations that enable them to be. A postscript of his hopeful design for a new World Center relates even more of his ideas, and essays by Anthony Vidler and Paul Virilio offer insights into the significance of the work.","price":"USD 50.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Theodor Storm"],"pubdate":"2003-4-15","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"德国","title":"德国"},{"count":1,"name":"特奥多·施托姆","title":"特奥多·施托姆"},{"count":1,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"外国文学","title":"外国文学"},{"count":1,"name":"TheodorStorm","title":"TheodorStorm"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6565389.jpg","binding":"Taschenbuch","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"160","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6565389.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6565389.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6565389.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6558306\/","id":"6558306","publisher":"Fischer (Tb.), Frankfurt","isbn10":"3596159822","isbn13":"9783596159826","title":"Der Schimmelreiter","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6558306","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"EUR 6.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Truth About the Coming Climate Catastrophe and Our Last Chance to Save Humanity","author":["James Hansen (Author)"],"pubdate":"2010-12","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"society","title":"society"},{"count":2,"name":"Politics","title":"Politics"},{"count":2,"name":"Climate","title":"Climate"},{"count":1,"name":"气候","title":"气候"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6448642.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"319","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6448642.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6448642.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6448642.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6505010\/","id":"6505010","publisher":"Bloomsbury USA","isbn10":"1608195023","isbn13":"9781608195022","title":"Storms of My Grandchildren","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6505010","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"An urgent and provocative call to action from the world's leading climate scientist, who reveals for the first time what we need to know about humanity's last chance to get off the path to a catastrophic global meltdown and why we don't know the half of it.","price":"$ 18.08"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":4,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Grotenstein, Jonathan;

This led to the release of six follow-up hits, inspired a host of imitations, and generated a long-playing sub-genre in art and design publishing.    Album Cover Album  is edited and compiled by two designers who were among the most innovative pioneers of the work that it celebrates. Storm Thorgerson's Hipgnosis earned world renown for the epic photo shoots and iconic designs that went so perfectly with the music of Pink Floyd. Meanwhile, Roger Dean's dreamscapes and unique typography became as much a part of the rock generation as the Yes albums they adorned.  Album Cover Album  features their selection of more than 600 sleeves in full color, and showcases the astonishing diversity and excellence of design that the medium produced in its first three decades.   This new edition retains the lavish 12-inch format of the original and replays the ingeniously themed compositions of each page. The album is given a fresh spin by a new preface from Peter Gabriel and new forewords by Storm Thorgerson and John Wetton, plus a 21  st  -century typographic facelift. The result is a celebration of the enduring appeal of vinyl.","price":"USD 29.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"How I Found My Heart in the Middle of the Ocean","author":["Tori Murden Mcclure"],"pubdate":"2009-4-1","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"传记","title":"传记"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4234900.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","ebook_url":"https:\/\/read.douban.com\/ebook\/28297090\/","pages":"304","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4234900.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4234900.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4234900.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4695234\/","id":"4695234","publisher":"Harper","isbn10":"0061718866","isbn13":"9780061718861","title":"A Pearl in the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4695234","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"\"In the end,\" writes Tori McClure, \"I know I rowed across the Atlantic to find my heart, but in the beginning, I wasn't aware that it was missing.\"       During June 1998, Tori McClure set out to row across the Atlantic Ocean by herself in a twenty-three-foot plywood boat with no motor or sail. Within days she lost all communication with shore, but nevertheless she decided to keep going. Not only did she lose the sound of a friendly voice, she lost updates on the location of the Gulf Stream and on the weather. Unfortunately for Tori, 1998 is still on record as the worst hurricane season in the North Atlantic. In deep solitude and perilous conditions, she was nonetheless determined to prove what one person with a mission can do. When she was finally brought to her knees by a series of violent storms that nearly killed her, she had to signal for help and go home in what felt like complete disgrace.     Back in Kentucky, however, Tori's life began to change in unexpected ways. She fell in love. At the age of thirty-five, she embarked on a serious relationship for the first time, making her feel even more vulnerable than sitting alone in a tiny boat in the middle of the Atlantic. She went to work for Muhammad Ali, who told her that she did not want to be known as the woman who \"almost\" rowed across the Atlantic Ocean. And she knew that he was right.     In this thrilling story of high adventure and romantic quest, Tori McClure discovers through her favorite way—the hard way—that the most important thing in life is not to prove you are superhuman but to fully to embrace your own humanity. With a wry sense of humor and a strong voice, she gives us a true memoir of an explorer who maps her world with rare emotional honesty.","ebook_price":"99.79","price":"USD 25.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Shooting Script","author":["James Schamus"],"pubdate":"1997","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"李安","title":"李安"},{"count":2,"name":"screenplay","title":"screenplay"},{"count":2,"name":"James_Schamus","title":"James_Schamus"},{"count":2,"name":"JamesSchamus","title":"JamesSchamus"},{"count":1,"name":"剧本","title":"剧本"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3948173.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3948173.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3948173.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3948173.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3992073\/","id":"3992073","publisher":"Newmarket Press","isbn10":"1854593226","isbn13":"9781854593221","title":"The Ice Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3992073","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["村崎 翠","D3パブリッシャー"],"pubdate":"2012-9-22","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"漫画","title":"漫画"},{"count":1,"name":"日本","title":"日本"},{"count":1,"name":"少女漫画","title":"少女漫画"},{"count":1,"name":"少女","title":"少女"},{"count":1,"name":"❤少女漫乙女心❤","title":"❤少女漫乙女心❤"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s22711326.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s22711326.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s22711326.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s22711326.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/19970128\/","id":"19970128","publisher":"アスキー・メディアワークス","isbn10":"4048910310","isbn13":"9784048910316","title":"STORM LOVER夏恋!!

Habeck is Associate Professor of Strategic Studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. She is the author of Knowing the Enemy: Jihadist Ideology and the War on Terror and coeditor of Spain Betrayed: The Soviet Union in the Spanish Civil War and The Great War and the Twentieth Century.","summary":"In this fascinating account of the battle tanks that saw combat in the European Theater of World War II, Mary R. Habeck traces the strategies developed between the wars for the use of armored vehicles in battle. Only in Germany and the Soviet Union were truly original armor doctrines (generally known as \"blitzkreig\" and \"deep battle\") fully implemented. Storm of Steel relates how the German and Soviet armies formulated and chose to put into practice doctrines that were innovative for the time, yet in many respects identical to one another.\nAs part of her extensive archival research in Russia, Germany, and Britain, Habeck had access to a large number of formerly secret and top-secret documents from several post-Soviet archives. This research informs her comparative approach as she looks at the roles of technology, shared influences, and assumptions about war in the formation of doctrine. She also explores relations between the Germans and the Soviets to determine whether collaboration influenced the convergence of their armor doctrines.","series":{"id":"7880","title":"Cornell Studies in Security Affairs"},"price":"USD 42.50"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A True Story of Men Against the Sea","author":["Sebastian Junger"],"pubdate":"2005-1-1","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29875545.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"112","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29875545.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29875545.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29875545.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1997762\/","id":"1997762","publisher":"Macmillan Education","isbn10":"1405073128","isbn13":"9781405073127","title":"The Perfect Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1997762","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP 6.10"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History","author":["Larson, Erik\/ Cline, Isaac Monroe"],"pubdate":"2000","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"ErikLarson","title":"ErikLarson"},{"count":1,"name":"2012","title":"2012"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7058131.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"323","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7058131.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7058131.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7058131.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4498668\/","id":"4498668","publisher":"Vintage Books","isbn10":"143956468X","isbn13":"9781439564684","title":"Isaac's Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4498668","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"23.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":13,"average":"7.3","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["[美] 克里斯蒂·高登"],"pubdate":"2019-7-16","tags":[{"count":6,"name":"魔兽","title":"魔兽"},{"count":5,"name":"奇幻","title":"奇幻"},{"count":4,"name":"暴雪","title":"暴雪"},{"count":3,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"2019","title":"2019"}],"origin_title":"World of Warcraft: Before the Storm","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33312930.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":["李镭"],"catalog":"","ebook_url":"https:\/\/read.douban.com\/ebook\/126030062\/","pages":"368","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s33312930.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s33312930.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33312930.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/30377825\/","id":"30377825","publisher":"北京时代华文书局","isbn10":"756992780X","isbn13":"9787569927801","title":"魔兽世界：风暴前夕","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/30377825","alt_title":"World of Warcraft: Before the Storm","author_intro":"克里斯蒂˙高登，“魔兽世界”系列小说的传奇作者，《纽约时报》热销书榜的常客，著名科幻女作家，创作力超级旺盛，已出版了四十多部长篇小说，作品横跨科幻、奇幻及恐怖等多个类型。除了“魔兽世界”系列作品外，她还创作了“星际迷航”系列小说。\n高登是“魔兽世界”游戏的死忠粉，曾经创作了多部大卖的魔兽系小说，在国内都有出版。这本《魔兽世界：风暴前夕》是她在半引退般沉寂了很久后重新出山，创作的全新作品。","summary":"# 魔兽世界WOW全新故事，长篇小说！高度配合全新资料片“争霸艾泽拉斯”！\n# 克里斯蒂·高登重新出山之作，暴雪娱乐官方授权，年度巨献！\n# 都说Blizzard要凉凉，这回实力打脸！全球霸道网游“魔兽世界”永远不凉！\n* 全球超级网游“魔兽世界”新老玩家、粉丝必备，承接全新版本与老版本游戏的官方授权小说！新玩家找激情，老玩家找情怀！\n* 超过1500万玩家同时在线，影响全世界几亿人的霸道网游“魔兽世界”推出全新资料片“争霸艾泽拉斯”后的首本长篇小说！\n* “魔兽世界”大神级作家克里斯蒂•高登隐退多年后重新出山，倾情创作出这部属于新魔兽时代的小说，讲述7.0版本后的情节发展，以及交待8.0版本的全新故事，延续之前创造的热卖奇迹！\n* “魔兽世界”系列小说创造过全球销量突破800万册的销售奇迹，现在奇迹延续！\n艾泽拉斯正在面临毁灭。部落和联盟击联手败了燃烧军团，不过一场可怕的灾难正在爆发。艾泽拉斯的心脏被堕落的泰坦萨格拉斯用宝剑刺出了一个致命的伤口。\n对暴风城的国王和部落首领、被遗忘者西尔瓦纳斯女王来说，几乎没有时间重建，更没有时间去哀悼。艾泽拉斯的毁灭性创伤揭示了一种神秘的物质——艾泽里特。在正义的人手中，这种神奇的黄金物质能够创造出令人难以置信的壮举；在邪恶的人手中，它可能带来不可想象的毁灭。\n随着联盟和部落的力量竞相揭开艾泽里特的秘密并治愈受伤的世界。国王制定了一个绝望计划，目的是在联盟和部落之间建立永久的和平。艾泽里特破坏了力量的平衡，所以国王必须得到希尔瓦纳斯的信任。但是，和以往一样，黑暗女王也有她自己的阴谋诡计。\n为了使和平成为可能，必须结束几代人的流血冲突和仇恨。但也有一些事实表明，联盟和部落双方都不愿意接受，谁都不愿放弃野心。就像联盟和部落都紧紧抓住艾泽里特的力量一样，他们之间一触即发的冲突很有可能演变成一场全面战争，一场给艾泽拉斯带来毁灭的战争。","ebook_price":"28.00","price":"56.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["P.

In this groundbreaking work, Dr. Heidi Cullen, one of the world's foremost climatologists and environmental journalists, puts a vivid face on climate change, offering a new way of seeing this phenomenon not just as an event set to happen in the distant future but as something happening right now in our own backyards. Arguing that we must connect the weather of today with the climate change of tomorrow, Cullen combines the latest research from scientists on the ground with state-of-the-art climate-model projections to create climate-change scenarios for seven of the most at-risk locations around the world.     From the Central Valley of California, where coming droughts will jeopardize the entire state's water supply, to Greenland, where warmer temperatures will give access to mineral wealth buried beneath ice sheets for millennia, Cullen illustrates how, if left unabated, climate change will transform every corner of the world by midcentury. What emerges is a mosaic of changing weather patterns that collectively spell out the range of risks posed by global warming—whether it's New York City, whose infrastructure is extremely vulnerable to even a relatively weak category 3 hurricane, or Bangladesh, a country so low-lying that millions of people could become climate refugees due to rising sea levels.     Provocative and convincing,  The Weather of the Future  makes climate change local, showing how no two regions of the country or the world will be affected in quite the same way, and demonstrating that melting ice is just the beginning.","ebook_price":"93.16","price":"USD 25.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Gould, Stephen Jay"],"pubdate":"1988-10","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"Evolution","title":"Evolution"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7085089.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"256","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7085089.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7085089.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7085089.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6357187\/","id":"6357187","publisher":"","isbn10":"0393305376","isbn13":"9780393305371","title":"Urchin in the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6357187","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Ranging as far as the fox and as deep as the hedgehog (the urchin of his title), Stephen Jay Gould expands on geology, biological determinism, \"cardboard Darwinism,\" and evolutionary theory in this sparkling collection.","price":"101.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":4,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storm, Theodore W."],"pubdate":"","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"德语文学","title":"德语文学"},{"count":1,"name":"Poetry","title":"Poetry"},{"count":1,"name":"Germany","title":"Germany"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8717708.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"82","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8717708.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8717708.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8717708.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7907376\/","id":"7907376","publisher":"","isbn10":"1463899432","isbn13":"9781463899431","title":"Immensee","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7907376","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 21.41"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"2013-3-27","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"—原画集と公式书と资料设定集—","title":"—原画集と公式书と资料设定集—"},{"count":1,"name":"菊家","title":"菊家"},{"count":1,"name":"畫集","title":"畫集"},{"count":1,"name":"画集","title":"画集"},{"count":1,"name":"已入荷","title":"已入荷"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26012704.jpg","binding":"大型本","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"127","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s26012704.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s26012704.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26012704.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/22889918\/","id":"22889918","publisher":"エンターブレイン","isbn10":"4047288764","isbn13":"9784047288768","title":"STORM LOVER スチルセレクション バカップルカスタム!!

And mankind is not ready.\n\nThe final volume of the Wheel of Time,  A Memory of Light,  was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson,  New York Times  bestselling author of the Mistborn books, was chosen by Jordan’s editor--his wife, Harriet McDougal--to complete the final book. The scope and size of the volume was such that it could not be contained in a single book, and so Tor proudly presents  The Gathering Storm  as the first of three novels that will cover the outline left by Robert Jordan, chronicling Tarmon Gai'don and Rand al'Thor's final confrontatino with the Dark One. This short sequence will complete the struggle against the Shadow, bringing to a close a journey begun almost twenty years ago and marking the conclusion of the Wheel of Time, the preeminent fantasy epic of our era.\n\nIn this epic novel, Robert Jordan’s international bestselling series begins its dramatic conclusion. Rand al’Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward--wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders--his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.\n\nEgwene al’Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower--and possibly the world itself.\n\nThe Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.","price":"USD 9.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Turbulent History Of Weather Prediction From Franklin'S Kite To El Ninosupplement1 Brown Pyrimidines","author":["Cox, John D."],"pubdate":"2002-8","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":1,"name":"科普","title":"科普"},{"count":1,"name":"我想读这本书","title":"我想读这本书"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8012530.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"252","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8012530.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8012530.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8012530.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4624935\/","id":"4624935","publisher":"","isbn10":"047138108X","isbn13":"9780471381082","title":"The Storm Watchers","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4624935","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"A lively, inspiring account of the pioneers who sought to accurately predict the weather  Benjamin Franklin ...James P.

Where they saw patterns and processes, others saw randomness and tumult-and yet they strove to make their voices heard, often saving lives in the process.  Storm Watchers takes you on a fascinating journey through time that captures the evolution of weather forecasting. From the age when meteorology was considered one step removed from sorcery to the modern-day wizardry of supercomputers, John Cox introduces you to the pioneering scientists whose work fulfilled an ancient dream and made it possible to foretell the future.

After its founding in 509 BCE, the Romans refused to allow a single leader to seize control of the state and grab absolute power. The Roman commitment to cooperative government and peaceful transfers of power was unmatched in the history of the ancient world.\nBut by the year 133 BCE, the republican system was unable to cope with the vast empire Rome now ruled. Almost as soon as they had conquered the Mediterranean, Rome became engulfed in violent political conflicts and civil wars that would destroy the Republic less than a century later.\nChronicling the years 133-80 BCE, The Storm Before the Storm is a rollicking deep-dive into the bloody battles, political machinations, and human drama that defined a dangerous new political environment--a stark warning for modern readers about what happens to a civilization driven by increasing economic inequality, political polarization, and ruthless ambition.","price":"USD 27.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Brassey, Lady Annie"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21026199.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"544","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s21026199.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s21026199.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21026199.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/17643991\/","id":"17643991","publisher":"","isbn10":"1593333048","isbn13":"9781593333041","title":"Sunshine and Storm in the East, or Cruises to Cyprus and Consunshine and Storm in the East, or Cruises to Cyprus and Consunshine and Storm in the East","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/17643991","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""}]}

Their campaign of sea and shore, emboldened by a revolutionary technology, brought wealth, honor, and power to their confederacy while alienating colonial neighbors and thwarting English and French imperialism. Afloat, Indian hunter-warriors commanded fleets of sailing ships and coordinated punitive and plundering assaults on the heart of England's Atlantic economy.

University）艺术教授，霍华德·斯道姆先生并不是一个令人愉快的人。他公开宣称自己是无神论者，敌视任何形式的宗教和它们的信徒。他常常发怒，想控制周遭的人，没有什么东西能让他感到喜乐。任何看不见、摸不着、感觉不到的东西他都不信。他确信物质世界包容了一切的存在，而所有与宗教有关的信仰都是自欺欺人的空想。在科学领域之外，别无它物。\n1985年6月1日，38岁的霍华德·斯道姆罹患胃穿孔而有了濒死经历，他的生命也因此永远地改变了。在我编辑的生命后经历的材料中，他的濒死经历如果不是最意义深刻的也一定是其中之一。他前后判若两人，辞去了教授的职务，投身于联合神学院学习并最终成为基督联合教会的一名牧师。","summary":"以下是霍华德·斯道姆牧师的自叙，摘自他的《坠入死亡》一书，承蒙许可在此发表。\n“带领你最接近上帝的宗教是最好的宗教。”——霍华德·斯道姆牧师\n幽灵的地狱之邀\n[霍华德·斯道姆在垂死的极度痛苦中]\n在巨大的悲伤中，我挣扎着同妻子告别。我一边艰难地跟她说永别了，一边尽可能地告诉她我很爱她。\n稍感放松并合上双眼，我等待着终结。这就是我认为的一个你不会从中醒来的巨大的虚无和失去知觉，是生存的结束。我绝对肯定此生之外不会有任何东西，因为精明的人实际上都是这么认为的。\n遭受如此的压力，祈祷或类似的事从未发生在我身上，我从来没想过它们。如果我提到了上帝的名，那实在是亵渎。\n像是昏迷或睡着了一会儿，具体延续了多长时间我不能肯定，只觉得很怪异。我睁开了双眼，感到惊讶的是我发现自己挨着床站着，还正在看着我那躺在床上的身体。\n我的第一反应是：“真是疯狂！我怎能既站在这里又朝下看见自己躺在那里？这不可能！”\n这不是我所预想的，这不对。为什么我仍然活着？我想忘掉它。是的，我正看着我的身体，而它似乎对我已经没有多大意义了。\n当我明白了发生的事时，变得心烦意乱。我开始朝着我的妻子尖声喊叫，而她正像块石头一样坐在那里，无论我多么大声、粗暴地朝她叫喊、试图引起她的注意，她也不朝我看，一动也不动。这让我困惑、烦躁、生气，我又试图引起我的室友的注意，结果一样，他毫无反应。\n但愿这是个梦，我不停地告诉自己：“这一定是在梦里。”但我知道这不是梦。很奇怪，我感到有生以来从未有过的警觉、敏感、鲜活，我的感觉极其敏锐，一切都变得生动真切。在冰凉的地板上，我的光脚感到潮湿阴冷，这无疑是真的。我轻轻地捏紧拳头，吃惊地发现仅仅是轻轻地一握，手中就有如此之多的感觉。\n接着，我听到我的名字。我听到有声音在喊：“霍华德，霍华德，过来。”\n刚开始，我觉得好奇怪，这声音是从哪里来的呢？我发现这声音源于门口，而且有不同的声音在喊我。\n我问他们是谁，他们说：“我们在这里照顾你，我们会给你安排好的。跟我们来吧。”\n再一次地，我问他们是谁，是否是医生或护士？\n他们回答道：“快，来看看，你会看到的。”他们总是搪塞我的问题，给我的感觉是很急，并坚持要我出门。\n我不情愿地来到走廊里，身处一团薄雾中。这是一种浅色的雾，很淡，我甚至能看到自己的手。但我看不清那些喊我的人，他们在我前方约15至20 英尺的地方，更像是些隐隐绰绰的轮廓、黑影。每当我朝他们移动时，他们就会退到雾中，当我试图接近他们想辨认他们时，他们更是快速地退进雾的深处。于是我亦步亦趋，进入雾中也越来越深。\n这些怪异的生命体不停地催促我，要跟紧他们。\n我再三地问它们，我们要到哪里去？他们回答说：“快点！你会知道的。”随后，他们不再回答，只是不断地要我快快地跟着他们。\n他们还不断地告诉我，我的疼痛是毫无意义的，也是不必要的：“疼痛是胡扯的。”\n我知道我们已经走了几英里，偶尔地，我有种奇异的能力能回头看到医院的病房，我的身体仍旧静静地躺在病床上。每次看的时候，就好像是我漂浮在病房的上面朝下看一样，但似乎又有数百万英里的距离。我看到了我的妻子和病友仍在病房里，我想他们还不能帮助我，决定继续跟着这些人走。\n走了相当长的一段距离，这些生命体都围绕着我。他们带我穿行在薄雾中，我不知道究竟有多长时间，只觉得有一种真实的永恒感。从某种意义上讲我无法知道有多长时间，但感到是很长一段时间，可能是几天或几周了。\n随着我们渐行渐远，雾也越来越厚、越来越黑，这些人开始变了。起先，他们好像是快乐而顽皮，但当我们走了一段路后，一些人开始变得有敌意。我的问题越多，怀疑越大，他们愈是有敌意，粗暴专横。他们开始取笑我的赤裸的臀部，因我的病号服不能遮体；他们还嘲弄我是如何的可怜。我知道他们在谈论我，但当我想搞清楚他们究竟在说什么时，他们当中有人就会说：“嘘——，他会听到的，他会听到。”\n于是，其它的一些人像是警告那些攻击我的同伴，我听到他们似乎在警告那些攻击我的人要小心点，免得把我吓跑了。\n我对这一切感到好奇怪，继续发问，他们再三地催我赶快走，并要我住嘴。我心里忐忑不安，加上他们不断地骚扰我，我决定返回，但此时我已经不知道往哪里走了，我迷路了。没有任何参照物，有的只是雾和湿漉漉、凉乎乎的地面，我无法定位，失去了方向感。\n所有我跟他们之间的交流都停留在口头上，就像人类之间的交流一样。他们看来不知道我在想什么，我也不知道他们在想什么。但越来越明显，他们是骗子，我跟他们耗的时间越长，想要的帮助就越遥远。\n数小时前，我还希望死亡会终结我的痛苦不堪的生命，不料现在事情更糟，我被这群充满敌意而又残暴的家伙们挟持着，朝着黑暗中莫测的目的地而行。他们开始对我喊叫，恶狠狠地侮辱我，苛求我要尽快跟上，并不再回答我的问题。\n最后，我告诉他们我不再走一步了。这时，他们完全变了。他们变得更加有敌意，气势汹汹地要我跟他们走。一些人开始推搡我，而我则还击他们。\n随之而来的是疯狂的辱骂、尖叫和殴打，而我也像个野人一样同他们打斗。这期间，显而易见的是，他们一直玩得很开心。\n看起来对他们而言，这差不多像是一场游戏，而我是他们的玩物，我的痛苦就是他们的欢乐。他们想让我受伤，抓我、咬我。每当我赶走了一个，立刻就会有五个或更多的涌上来。\n此时，天气几乎完全黑了。我觉得他们不像是只有二十或三十个，而是数不胜数。他们源源不断地来参加伤害我的盛会，我的抵抗只会招到更多的戏弄。他们开始用最无耻的方式在肉体上羞辱我。当我继续与他们搏斗时，我意识到他们不急于取胜，而是像猫捉老鼠一样地玩弄我。每一轮新的攻击都伴随着刺耳的嚎叫。有时，他们撕破并扯下我身上的皮肉，我惊恐地意识到我要被他们慢慢地扯成碎片、生吞活剥了，这样，他们的娱乐就会尽可能的延长。\n我从来也不曾遇到过像这样无以复加、连人类也做不到的欺哄和攻击。贴切地说，他们是你所能想象得出的最坏的且没有一丁点好意的人。他们当中的一些人看上去能告诉其它人怎么做，但我感觉不到任何组织结构或阶层，他们似乎不像是受谁控制或领导。从根本上讲，他们就是一群被放肆而残暴的激情驱使的暴徒。\n在我们打斗时，我注意到他们似乎没有疼痛，但也没有什么特别的人类所没有的能力或超人类的能力。\n虽然在开始时，我以为他们穿了衣服，但在随后的肢体接触中，我没有感觉到任何类似衣服的东西。\n恶斗了好长一段时间，我最终精疲力竭、疲惫不堪地躺倒在他们中间，他们渐渐地安静下来，因为我不再是他们的玩物了，这使得他们当中的大多数人失望，但还有少数人仍然在挑逗、骚扰我，奚落我了然无趣。此时此刻，我已经饱受摧残，虽然他们还在不时地挑衅，我只能躺在那里像堆碎片，无力反抗了。\n究竟是怎样发生的……我不准备试着在这里解释，我只是觉得在我里面有一个声音，我自己的声音，说：“向上帝祈祷。”\n我的脑子里回答说：“我不祈祷。我不知道怎样祈祷。”\n我看到在黑暗中有一个人躺在地上，如果没有几百个也一定有数十个邪恶的生命体在撕扯他。这情形看上去是绝对没有希望了，不管我是否相信上帝，我都没有指望了。\n那个声音再次告诉我要向上帝祈祷。我犹豫不决，不知道该怎样做。第三次，那个声音告诉我要向上帝祈祷。\n我开始说一些诸如：“耶和华是我的牧者，我必不至缺乏……上帝保佑美国。”之类的好像是宗教上的用语。\n就像是向那些家伙们泼了一盆滚烫的油，他们全都狂暴不止，不住地朝我大喊大叫，要我停下，因为没有上帝，没人能听到我的声音。但就在他们尖声喊叫、污言秽语时，全都朝后面退去──好像我是毒药。他们一边后退，一边像疯狗一样地尖叫、咒诅，说我是懦夫，我所说的毫无价值。\n我也朝他们高喊：“我们在天上的父……”等等。就这样，持续了一段时间，突然，我感到他们已经走了。天色黑暗，我独自在那里呼喊着一些听起来是教会的用语。这些用语对付这些可怕的生命体如此有效，我感到高兴。\n躺在那里有很长时间，我处在如此无助、绝望的黑暗中，没有办法知道究竟有多长时间了。我只是躺在无名之地──一切都是破碎而恍惚，我没有一点力气，一切都完了。就像是衰竭了，我的任何努力都将消耗最后的一点能量。我觉得自己正在枯萎，沉到黑暗中。\n被耶稣基督救出地狱\n现在，我甚至不知道我是否还在这个世界上，但我确定我在这里。我真实地存在着，所有的意识如此痛楚地清醒着。我不知道我是怎样到这里的，即便在体力能行走，也没有方向可循。我所能感觉得到的就是这一天所遭受的巨大苦楚是无与伦比，这就是我存在的绝对的终点，它比我曾经所能想象得到的任何东西都更可怕。\n这时，一件最不平凡的事发生了，我再一次地非常清晰地听到我自己的声音，是小时候在教会主日学学到的东西，是一首短歌：“耶稣爱我，我知道……”且不断地重复。不知道为什么，我忽然想相信它。什么也没留下，我想依靠这个念头。于是，我由衷地、用尽最后残存的一点气力和知觉喊叫着：“耶稣，请你救救我！”\n当我这样做的时候，我看到在黑暗中的某处，有一个很微小的星星，不知道它究竟是什么，我推测它一定是颗彗星或流星，因它在快速地移动，而且我发现它冲着我而来，迅速地越变越亮。\n当光靠近我的时候，它的光辉洒满在我的身上，我站起来了──不是我的努力，而是被提起来的。接着，我看见──非常真切地看见，我身上所有的伤口、眼泪、破裂逐渐消除，在光辉中我变得完好无损。\n我能做的就是不由自主地号淘大哭，不是因为我脱离了悲惨的境地，而是我感受到了今生前所未有的东西。\n另外一件事发生了，我一下子知道了大量的东西上，我知道……我知道这光和这光辉熟悉我。我不知道如何向你解释这一点，但当时我就明白了这点。事实上，我知道它比我的父母还要了解我。这个明亮的光体亲密地拥抱着我、理解我，并开始传授大量的有知识的意识。我知道他晓得我的一切，无条件地爱我、接纳我。\n这光传达给我信息：它以一种我还不能表达的方式爱我，我从来不知道爱还能这样。他是一个集中的能量场，发出的光彩难以言表，只能说是美善和爱，比任何人想象的更亲爱。\n我知道这光辉威力强大，它使我整个人感觉良好。我能感受到它的光照在我的身上，像非常轻柔的手环绕着我；我还能感到它扶持我，同时以无法抗拒的力量爱我。在饱受折磨之后，得到这光体完全的理解、接纳和热烈的爱──这爱超过了我的所知所想，我一边泪如泉涌，一边随着光体上升，离开那里。\n我们越来越快，脱离了黑暗。被光环绕着，我感到十分惬意，不停地哭泣。我远远地看到像是星系的图景，不同的是比我曾在地球上观看时更大，有更多的星星。\n有一个巨大的光明的中心，里面有一个非常明亮的集中点，外里有数不清的光球朝着里面的一个巨大的生命体飞进去或飞出来。它们很远。\n这时，我……我没有用嘴说，只是在意念里说：“把我放回去。”\n我的意思是告诉光把我放回到刚才的深渊中，因我对自己及自己一生所做的事深感羞愧，只想隐藏在黑暗中。我想不再朝着那大光前行了──想停但却没有停。在我的这一生中，不知有多少次我曾否认且嘲笑这位在我面前的真实存在；也不知有多少次我以它为诅咒。多么难以置信的理性上的傲慢，竟以它的名为侮辱。我害怕靠近它。我还想到，也许这些强烈得惊人的辐射会将我在感觉上还是完整无缺的身体分崩离析。\n[编按: 霍华德认为他的这位朋友是耶稣。]\n扶持我的这个生命体，我的朋友，意识到了我的畏惧、勉强和羞愧。第一次，他以一个男性的声音在我的思想中告诉我，如果我不舒服，我们就不去靠近。所以我们停下，距离那个伟大的生命体仍无数英里远。\n也是第一次，我的朋友，下文中我要用“他”相称，对我说：“你属于这里。”\n面对这些光辉，我强烈地感到自己的卑贱，我回答到：“不，你搞错了，把我放回去。”\n他说：“我们不会错。你属于。”\n随后，他用一种悦耳的音调呼唤那些环绕着巨大中心的发光体。有几个发光体来到我们跟前，围绕着我们。在接下来的时间里，他们有些来、有些去，但通常有五到六个、有时甚至有八个和我们在一起。\n我还在哭。他们来的第一件事都是关切地询问我：“你害怕我们吗？”\n我告诉他们我不怕。\n他们说，他们可以把他们的辉光减弱点，这样会显得像人。我告知他们保持原样好了。他们是最美、最……\n说点题外话，我是艺术教授，知道在可见光谱中有三原色、三次色和六种三级色。但在这里，我看见的可见光谱至少有80种新的原色，还有这些光辉，我想去描述它，但遗憾的是办不到──这些色彩是我从未见过的。\n这些生命体展现给我的是他们的荣光，我并非真正地看见了他们。我实在很惬意。来自于一个有形有体的世界，我很高兴和这些新的无形状的生命在一起。这些生命体给了我此时此刻所需要的一切。\n让我吃惊和沮丧的是，他们似乎能知道我所想的一切。我不知道如何控制我的思想来保守秘密。\n我们开始进行思想交流，会话非常的自然、容易和随意。我听到他们的声音清晰而独特，每个生命体有不同个性的声音，但他们都直接对着我的思想说话而不是耳朵，他们使用普通的英语口语。我所想的任何事情他们都知道。\n他们似乎全都很了解我，完全熟悉我的思想和我的过去。我没有任何念头要从中寻找我已经认识的，因为他们全都了解我。没有人能比他们更了解我了。我也没有想到要去把他们看从自己的伯父和祖父，就像是在圣诞节时有许多的亲戚聚在一起，你无法记住每一个人的名字、他们是否已经结婚、跟你有什么联系，但你知道你是在和你的家人在一起。我不知道这些生命体跟我有没有关系，我只觉得他们比任何我认识的人都亲密。\n我和这些发光的生命体的谈话似乎延续了很长时间，从头至尾，我的身体都被那位笼罩着我的生命体扶着，从某种意义上讲，我们是完全固定地悬在空中的。周围到处都是无数发光的生命体，像空中的星星，来来去去。这场景就像是一个夸张的塞满了大量星星的星系。在那个中心硕大的光辉中，许许多多的光体挤在一起，你无法单独地分辩他们。每一个光体都与造物主很融洽，他们实在是一体的。\n我被告知，所有这些数不胜数的生命体不得不回到他们的源头的一个原因，是在这种和谐、合一的感觉中充满活力。相隔太久会让他们变弱，会让他们感到孤独。他们最大的快乐就是回到所有生命的源头。\n在最初的谈话中，他们仅仅是安慰我。\n我有点不安，因为我赤身裸体。刚才在黑暗中我丢失了我的病号袍，我是一个人，有一个身体。他们告诉我，这没关系，他们非常熟悉我的身体构造。渐渐地，我放松下来，不再试图用手遮掩我的私处。\n接下来，他们要谈论我的一生。让我惊讶地是我的一生在我的面前被播放了出来，距我大约只有六或八英尺的距离，从开始到结束。这个生命的回顾由他们很好的控制着，他们让我观看，但不是从我的观点出发。我看到自己的一生──整个过程是一节功课，虽然当时我还不知道这点。他们试图教导我一些东西，但我当时不知道这是一个教学经验，因为我不知道我还要回来。\n我们从头到尾地观看，有些事情他们慢下来，放大；有些事情一带而过。我的一生被以一种我从未想过的方式展现出来，所有我曾努力地为之奋斗而得到东西和赏识，无论是小学、中学、大学还是在我的职业生涯中，都被他们视为无关紧要。\n随着我的生命回顾的不断展现，我能感到他们的悲伤、痛苦和快乐。他们不说这是好的或坏的，但我能感觉得到。我能意识到他们漠不关心的事，比方说，他们并不轻视我在中学破记录的铅球成绩，但他们对它、还有许多我非常引以为傲的东西不以为然。\n他们总是对我与别人的相处有回应，不论长短。不幸的是，我对别人的反应大多数都比我应该做的差，我本应当用爱的方式。\n无论如何，在我的一生中，当我以爱的方式回应别人时，他们欢喜快乐。\n我发现自己在与别人的相处中，大多时候是操纵别人、表里不一。比方说，在我的职业生涯中，我看见自己以教授的身份坐在办公室里，当时有一名学生前来谈论个人问题，只见我表面上满有同情心、耐心和爱心，但在心里却是烦得要命，以至于在桌子底下看表，巴望着这名学生早点了事。\n当我还是一名十几岁的青少年时，我的父亲每天工作十二个小时，不堪重负，他也因此疏忽了我。当他下班回家时，我为了表示对他的愤恨，冷冰冰地不理会他，这使他很生气，他的怒气又让我更有籍口恨他。我们吵架，我的母亲则伤心不已。\n在我一生中的大部分的时间里，我都视父亲为恶棍，自己是受害者。当我和那些生命体回顾我的一生时，我恍然大悟：在每天结束的时候，我不是愉快地去问候父亲，而是频繁地去烦扰他，只是为了证明我的伤害是对的。\n我又看见在一个夜晚，我妹妹感到非常不舒服，我是如何走进她的卧室、拥抱着她，没有说一句话，我只是躺在那里，双臂抱着她。这成为我一生中最为得意的经历。\n爱的医治，启迪开悟\n如果不是我的朋友和他的朋友们的爱，整个生命的回顾会使我的情绪受到巨大的伤害，我一定会发疯。但我能感觉到他们的爱，每当我感到不安的时候，他们将画面关闭一会儿。他们纯粹是爱我，他们的爱是切切实实的，你能在身上感到它，在身内感到它，他们的爱穿透你。我希望我能向你解释清楚，但做不到。\n他们的爱医治了我，因为我的生命的回顾让人崩溃。我可怜地观看着，只有可怜。我不敢相信这些，但看上去是越来越糟，当我长大成人后，只是将青少年的愚昧、自私扩大了，这一切都是在成为好丈夫、好父亲和好公民的外表的下面，伪善得令人作呕。自始至终，他们的爱与我相伴。\n当回顾结束时，他们问我：“你有什么问题吗？”是的，我有成千上万的问题。\n比方说，我问道：“圣经怎么样？”\n“圣经的什么怎么样？”他们反问道。\n我问他们，圣经是否真实？他们说它是真实的；我又问他们，为何当我试图去读圣经时，看到矛盾百出？他们让我再看看我的生命回顾──有些情节我漏掉了，他们显现出来，我看到只有很少的几次我打开圣经，带着挑刺的想法去读它，我试图证明圣经不值得一读。\n我请他们留意，对我而言，圣经晦涩、平淡无奇。他们告诉我，圣经包含了属灵的真理，要想明白它就要在灵里去读它，要以虔诚的态度去读。我的这些朋友们都告知我，圣经不像其它的书。他们还告诉我，后来我也发现了这点，当你以敬虔的心去读圣经时，它会跟你说话，会向你揭示它的意义，用不着你冥思苦想。\n我的朋友们以非常有趣的方式回答了许多问题。他们很了解我的语气，当我在脑海中思考问题、在我说出问题前，他们就知道了。\n比方说，我问他们，哪个宗教最好？我期待的答案像是：“长老会。”我把他们都看成是基督徒。\n我得到的答案是：“让你最接近上帝的宗教是最好的宗教。”\n我又问他们是否有生命在其它的星球上，他们的回答让我惊讶：宇宙中充满了生命。\n因我害怕核战的大毁灭，我就问他们世界上是否会有一场核子大战，他们说，没有。这也让我惊奇，我就解释了一番，告诉他们我是如何生活在核战的阴影下，这也是我成为现在这个样子的一个原因，在我的一生中，充满了绝望，因为整个世界会被一阵核子狂风吹得无影无踪，没有什么值得留恋，也因此让我觉得想做什么就做什么，无关紧要。\n他们说：“不，不会有任何核战。”\n我说，你们绝对肯定吗？他们再次让我打消疑虑。我说你们怎么就能这么肯定呢？他们的回答是：“上帝爱世人。”\n他们告诉我，如果不销毁核武器的话，可能会有一、二件核武器意外的爆炸，但不会有核子大战。我又问，为什么会有那么多的战争呢？他们回答说，他们允许小部分的战争发生，走出战争后，仁爱会启动，人类会尝试创造，通过这小部分的战场，他们也让人类进入到他们的认识层面从而制止战争。\n科学技术和其它有益于人类的东西，他们告诉我，都是他们赐给人类的礼物──通过灵感。人们被逐步引领而有所发现，但其中的许多发现后来都被不正当地用来毁灭自己。我们会对这个星球造成巨大的损害，他们表示，星球上的一切都是上帝的创造，不仅是人，还有动物、树目、鸟类和昆虫等等。\n他们向我解释道，他们关心世界上所有的人而不是厚此薄彼。他们希望人人都认为别人比自己强、爱人如己甚至胜过爱自己。如果有人在世界的某个地方受到伤害，那么，我们也会受伤──我们痛痒相关，我们要帮助他们。\n我们的这个星球上已经进入到一个转折点，有史以来我们第一次有能力去做到全球相通，我们能成为一体。\n有人被赐于特别的恩惠来带领世界进入更美好的时代，去促进它的到来，这正是我们生活在美国的人。\n当我和他们谈论未来时──听起来似乎我已经逃避了未来的世界，他们明确地向我说明我们有自由意志。\n如果我们改变方法，我们就能改变他们展现给我看的未来。他们给我看了未来的景象，以我所体验到的而言，这要基于我们美国人在那时的作为。在这个未来中，将会发生全球性的巨大的不景气。然而，如果我们改变我们的行为，会有不一样的未来。\n我问他们怎么有可能来改变许多人的进程？我说，改变世上的任何事情，即使有可能话，也会是非常难的。我表示这是无望之举。\n我的朋友们非常清楚地向我解释，所发生的一切都是让一个人有改变，一个人经过努力，就会有另外的人变得更好。他们说，改变世界的唯一的方法就是开始改变一个人，一生二，二生三，如此下去，就会有显著的改变。\n我问他们在乐观的情况下──他们所期盼的改变已经发生，世界会走向何方？他们给我看的景象与我所想象的大相径庭，让我惊讶。\n我先前的想象有点电影《星球大战》的味道：太空时代、整容、科技，而他们给我看的几乎没有一点科技。\n在那个令人欣悦的未来中，人人，绝对是每一个人，他们大部分的时间所做的事是扶养儿童。人们首要关心的是儿童，大家都认为儿童是世上最珍贵的宝贝。这样，当儿童长大成人时，他们就不会忧虑、仇恨和对抗，有的只是巨大信用和相互的尊重。\n在这样的未来中，如果一个人遇到麻烦，整个群体都会关心到这个人与别人的不协调。人们通过在灵里祈祷和爱来振奋这个被烦恼困扰的人。\n人们在余下时间里做的事就是园艺。几乎不需要体力上的努力，通过祈祷，我看到那些植物结出丰硕的水果和菜蔬。万众一心，能通过祈祷来改变星球的气候。每个人都在相互信赖中工作──如果需要，人们可以呼风唤雨，也可以让艳阳高照。各样的动物也与人和谐相处。\n在这个最美好的世界上，人们对智慧而不是对知识感兴趣。这是因为人们处在一个必须是万事通的环境中，在知识的范畴内，他们可以简单地通过祈祷来接受。对他们而言，凡事都可以解决，他们能做他们想做的任何事。\n这里的人没有旅游热，因为他们能在灵里与世界上任何人沟通，没有必要到别的地方去。他们专注于自己的所在地及周围的人，没有必要去度假。度假干什么呢？他们已经十分快乐、圆满。\n在这个世界上，死亡是每个人经历了所需要经历的一切后来临的，它意味着躺下并得着释放。这时，灵魂会上腾，与降下来迎接他（她）的天使相见，集体中的人会在这个人的周围，兴高采烈，因为大家都洞悉天堂。他们能看见灵魂离去，继续它的未尽之旅，因它已经不适宜在这个世界上成长了。在这个世界上，死者在爱、欣赏、理解及与人和谐地配合等方面，都尽力而圆满了。\n我看到这个未来世界中的最美的风景是一个花园，上帝的花园。在这个花园中，最美丽的是人。人们降生来到这个世界，在认识上帝中不断地成长，然后，从这个物质世界毕业，脱下肉体的外壳，升上天堂──在那里，与上帝有更亲密的且不断成长的关系。\n[编者按：在霍华德·斯道姆的《我坠入死亡》（2000年）一书中，作者描绘了1985年在濒死经历中这些发光生命体给他看的人类未来。他说，1985年他们告诉他，冷战不久会结束，因为“上帝让人心改变，要去爱全世界的人”，斯道姆说：“在1985年，我被告知冷战会在几乎不流血的情况下结束。因为人们不愿意忍受独裁政府。”\n斯道姆写道，那些发光的生命体告诉他大约在2185年地球上要发生的事。他问他们：“在此变化中，美国会成为世界的领袖吗？”\n那些光体回答说：“美国已经被赐于机会去成为世界的导师，但给予的多收取的也多。已经赐于给美国的要超过给有史以来的任何一个国家，但美国在这些礼物上未能落落大方。如果美国继续贪得无厌地剥削世界上其它国家的资源，上帝的祝福将会离开它，它的经济将会崩溃并导致混乱。由于人的贪婪本性，人们会为了一小怀汽油而相互残杀。世人会惊恐地看着你们的国家被冲突彻底毁灭，其它国家不会施以援手，因为他们是你们剥削的牺牲品，他们会很高兴地看到如此自私的人灭绝。美国必须立即改变，成为仁慈、慷慨的楷模。今天，美国是向世界输出战争和暴力文化的头号大国。这快要结束了，因为你们拥有自我毁灭的种子。即使你们不自我毁灭上帝也要让这些结束，如果你们不改变的话。”\n斯道姆说：“……我不知道历史上最富裕的国家是命定要失去上帝的祝福还是要成为世界的灯塔。上帝还允许不公继续到何时？未来取决于我们现在所做的。上帝直接地干预人类事件。愿上帝的旨意行在地上如同行在天上。”\n霍华德·斯道姆的这些发光生命体朋友告诉他许多有关将要来临的新世界。据他们所说，上帝希望在未来的两百年开创新国度。为此，上帝已经废止了一些给人的自由意志，以便神启地控制一些人类事件。这个新世界的秩序，据斯道姆所说，会类似于一些濒死经历所描述的天堂。人们会如此平安祥和、彼此相爱的生活：用心灵感应交流；瞬间到达旅行地；不再需要衣物蔽体；狮子与羔羊躺在一起。]\n了解死后发生的事\n我问我的朋友和他的那些朋友们有关死亡的事──当我们死后会发生什么事？\n他们说：“当一个可爱的人死后，天使会下来见他，带他上去──开始是渐渐地，因为如果让他立刻见到上帝，他会受不了。\n天使知道各人的内心，用不着以炫耀的方式来证明什么，他们知道并供给我们所需，有时也许只是天堂的草坪，有时是其它的东西。如果一个人非常喜欢珠宝，它们会向他展现珠宝。我们看见的东西是我们进入灵界所需要的东西，在天堂里，这些东西是真实而神圣的。\n他们逐渐地教育我们这些灵体，带我们进入天堂。我们不断地成长，长大，脱去各样的欲念和那些基于动物禀性的、我们一生大部分时间为之争斗的东西，现世的各种欲望也渐渐去掉，我们不再为它们奋斗，我们回归到本来面目──神圣的一部分。\n这一切发生在可那些可爱的人身上，这些人友好而且爱上帝。我的这些朋友们清楚地告诉我，我们没有任何知识和权力去论断其它的人──人心直接与上帝相关联，只有上帝知道人的心眼如何。有些人我们认为卑劣可憎，但也许上帝在那里却正人君子；同样，我们认为有些人是好人，但在上帝眼里他们也许是黑心肠的伪君子。只有上帝知道各人的真实情况。\n上帝最后审判各人，也会允许一些人被那些臭味相投的生命体牵引到黑暗中，具体的情况就像我曾遇到的。我没有看到更糟糕的情形，但我猜测我看到的仅是冰山的一角。\n我理所当然地去那里──在适当的时间去了适当的地方，对我而言，地点和周围的人物都相合。上帝让我经历这些，然后将我从那里挪开，因祂在整个的过程中看到了救赎同，这是净化我的一种方法。那些没有被允许拉到黑暗中的人，是因为他们可爱的性情被向上、朝着光吸引。\n我从未见到上帝，也不在天堂，像是在郊外的出口。他们让我看了一些东西，我们谈了很长时间、很多事情。然后，我看了一下自己，发现自己熠熠发光，变得非常美丽，虽没有像他们那样美，但确实有了从未有过的光芒。\n没有准备再回到地球，我告诉他们我希望能永远地跟他们在一起。我说：“我准备好了，我准备像你们一样，永远地在这里。这太好了。我爱它，我爱你们。你们太奇妙了。”\n我知道他们爱我并了解我的一切。从现在开始，一切都会好起来。我问他们我能否摆脱我的身体──它无疑是个累赘，成为像他们那样的生命体，并拥有他们在我面前所展现的那种能力。\n他们说：“不，你必须回去。”\n他们向我解释：我实属尚待发展，回到以肉体存的方式中对我大有裨益。在我的人类生活中，我有机会成长，这样下次我跟他们在一起时会更和谐。我需要发展许多重要的品格才能像他们那样去从事他们所做的事。\n我告诉他们我不想回去，并试着跟他们讨论。我说，如果我有这样的想法──我将再次卷曲在深渊的话，我恳求跟他们呆在一起。\n我的朋友们说：“甚至当你在地球上亵渎上帝、待你周围的人像尘土一样时，我们曾经差派人试着帮助你、教导你真理。有我们给你这一切的爱之后，你不相信我们希望你完美吗？你真的相信从现在开始我们会分开吗？”\n我回答道：“但我自己的失败感怎么办？你们已经让我看到我能做得更好，但我相信我无法做到。我没那么好。”\n自私自利在我的心中涌起，我说：“不行，我不回去。”\n他们说：“有人在关心你。你的妻子、孩子、父母，你要为了他们而回去。你的孩子需要你的帮助。”\n我说：“你们能帮助他们。如果你们让我回去却事与愿违，如果我回去却犯错误，我无法承受。因为你们让我看到我能更有爱心，更富于同情心，但我却忘掉了这些，反而愧对别人，或对别人做了非常糟糕的事，我知道这会发生的，因为我是人，那样，我会沮丧，不能忍受，以至于我会自杀。即或因为生活美好我不会自杀，我也会发疯。所以你们不能打发我回去。”\n他们向我保证，错误是人类的可以接受的部分。\n“去吧，”他们说：“犯你要犯的错误，从错误中学习。”\n只要做我认为是正确的事，他们说，这样我就会在正道上。如果我犯了错误，我必须充分地认识到它是一个错误，然后简单地让它过去，只要试着不要再犯同样的错误。重要的是要尽力而为，以仁善、真理为准绳，不要为了赢得人的赞誉而妥协。\n“但是，”我说：“错误让我难受。”\n他们说：“我们爱你，包括爱你选取的方式、犯的错误及全部的你。你能感觉到我们的宽恕。任何时候，只要你愿意，你都能感受到我们的爱。”\n我说：“我不明白。我该怎么做？”\n“只要转向内心世界，”他们说：“只要祈求我们的爱。如果你诚心祈求，我们就会给你。”\n他们劝告我，当我犯了一个错误时，我要认识它并祈求宽恕，甚至在我祈求的话还未出口时，我已经被宽恕了──但我必须接受宽恕。首要的原则是我必须相信宽恕是真实的并且已经得到了。公开或私下地忏悔自己犯了错，然后祈求宽恕。接下来，如果我不接受宽恕，那就是侮辱他们了。我不要再反反复复地怀着负罪感，不要重复错误──我要从错误中学习。\n“但是，”我说：“我怎样才能知道哪些是对的选择？哪些是你们要我做的呢？”\n他们回答：“我们希望你做你自己想做的事。这意味着要做出选择──没有必要只有一个正确的选择，而是一个可能的范围。你要从这些可能中做出你的最好的选择。如果你这样做了，我们会在那里帮助你。”\n我没有轻易地放弃，和他们争辩：回去充满了问题，而留在这里却有我想要的一切。我质疑我有能力去在我的世界中去实现任何一件他们认为是重要的事。他们说，世界是至高者优美的表达，人们发现美或丑，取决于自己思路。\n他们解释道：我们这个世界的精妙和复杂超越了我的理解，但我可以是造物主的一个合用的器皿。每一个受造物都无限有趣，因为它是造物主的显示。带着好奇和快乐去探索这个世界是我的一个良机。\n他们从未直接地给我一个任务或目的。要我为上帝建一个大教堂或圣殿吗？他们说，这些是为了人性的需要。他们要我在活着的一生中，爱人而不是物。我告诉他们我并非好得像我向他们描绘的那样世故老练。他们让我放心，无论何时，只要我需要，我会得到适当的帮助。我要做的就是祈求。\n这些发光的生命体，我的老师们，让人心悦诚服。同时，我也强烈地意识到不远就是伟大的生命体──我所知道的造物主。他们从没有说过：“祂希望这样……”但这意思却蕴涵在他们所说的一切的背后。我不想同他们争论太多，因为至尊的生命体是这样的奇妙和让人敬畏，散发出的爱让人无法抗拒。\n我提出不想回到这个世界的最大的论据是，我告诉他们如果离开了他们和他们的爱，我会心碎，我会死。回去是如此的残酷，我说，我无法忍受。我请他们注意，世界充满了仇恨和对抗，我不想回到这个大旋涡中。离开他们我无法承受。\n我的朋友们说，他们从未与我分开。我解释道，我还不明白他们的显现，如果我回去，我又会不知道他们在那里。他们向我解释如何与他们沟通，告诉我要让自己清静下来，精神内敛，祈求他们的爱，然后，那爱便来临，我会知道他们在那里。\n他们说：“你不会离开我们。我们与你同在，永远这样。我们一直与你同在。”\n我说：“但是，我怎么知道呢？你们是这样说的，但当我回去后，这是否仅是一个美丽的理论。”\n他们说：“任何时候，只要你需要，我们就会在那里。”\n我说：“就是说你们会显现？”\n他们说：“不，不。除非你需要我们，否则我们不会以明显的方式去干涉你的生活。我们只是在那里，你会感觉得到我们的存在，会感觉得到我们的爱。”\n在他们这样解释后，我停止了争论。我说，我想\n我能回去了。随后，就那样，我回来了，回到了我的肉体中，疼痛仍在，比先前更厉害。\n（霍华德·斯道姆濒死经历的描述到此结束。）\n对霍华德来讲，回到现世的生活中并不容易，除了身体上的问题外，他还不得不面对另一个问题，那就是人们对他新的灵命的不理解和迟钝的反应。这在医院里就开始了，他说。\n霍华德说：“对每一个人我都感到了无法抵抗的爱意。我想拥抱、亲吻每个人，但我甚至坐不起来。我会对每一个人说：‘哦，你真美！’我成了那层楼里的笑料，大家感到这很滑稽。”\n像其它有过濒死经历的人一样，霍华德对别人的同感、同情心扩大了。他说，同自己的情感相比，他能更强烈地感受到别人的情感。之后，霍华德决定进入基督教界的事工。","price":"157.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Thiele,

In this brilliant short book, Vince Cable, 'the sage of the credit crunch' (\"Daily Telegraph\") explains how we got here and where we're going. In \"The Storm\", Vincent Cable explains the causes of the world economic crisis and how we should respond to the challenges it brings. He shows that although the downturn is global, the complacency of the British government towards the huge 'bubble' in property prices and high levels of personal debt, combined with increasingly exotic and opaque trading within the financial markets, has left Britain badly exposed. Yet we need to be vigilant in our response to the dangers confronting us. Times of crises inevitably bring forth false prophets who offer easy panaceas and identify scapegoats. However, Cable shows that an insular response to the current crisis would be a disaster and urges us to resist the siren voices that promote isolationism and nationalism as the answer to economic woes. He argues that policy makers must keep their faith in liberal markets if the remarkable advances in living standards, which are now being extended to the world's poorer countries, are to be maintained.

The Second World War lasted for 2,174 days, cost $1.5 trillion, and claimed the lives of more than 50 million people. What were the factors that affected the war's outcome? Why did the Axis lose? And could they, with a different strategy, have won? Andrew Roberts's acclaimed new history has been hailed as the finest single-volume account of this epic conflict. From the western front to North Africa, from the Baltic to the Far East, he tells the story of the war—the grand strategy and the individual experience, the cruelty and the heroism—as never before.   In researching this magnificently vivid history, Roberts walked many of the key battlefields and wartime sites in Russia, France, Italy, Germany, and the Far East, and drew on a number of never-before-published documents, such as a letter from Hitler's director of military operations explaining the reasoning behind the FÜhrer's order to halt the Panzers outside Dunkirk—a delay that enabled British forces to evacuate. Roberts illuminates the principal actors on both sides and analyzes how they reached critical decisions. He also presents the tales of many little-known individuals whose experiences form a panoply of the extraordinary courage and self-sacrifice, as well as the terrible depravity and cruelty, of the Second World War.   Meticulously researched and masterfully written,  The Storm of War  gives a dramatic account of this momentous event and shows in remarkable detail why the war took the course it did.","price":"USD 52.11"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["George R.

A STORM OF SWORDS is the third volume in the series. A beautifully presented slipcased edition of A STORM OF SWORDS. The Seven Kingdoms are divided by revolt and blood feud, and winter approaches like an angry beast. Beyond the Northern borders, wildlings leave their villages to gather in the ice and stone wasteland of the Frostfangs. From there, the renegade Brother Mance Rayder will lead them South towards the Wall. The men of the Night's Watch are ready for the coming of a great cold and the walking corpses that travel with it. But now they face a horde of wildlings twenty-thousand strong - hungry savage people steeped in the dark magic of the haunted wilderness - poised to invade the Kingdom of the North where Robb Stark wears his new-forged crown. But Robb's defences are ranged against attack from the South, the land of House Stark's enemies the Lannisters. His sisters are trapped there, dead or likely yet to die, at the whim of the Lannister boy-king Joffrey or his depraved mother Cersei, regent of the Iron Throne.

In The Perfect Moral Storm, philosopher Stephen Gardiner illuminates our dangerous inaction by placing the environmental crisis in an entirely new light, considering it as an ethical failure. Gardiner clarifies the moral situation, identifying the temptations (or \"storms\") that make us vulnerable to a certain kind of corruption. First, the world's most affluent nations are tempted to pass on the cost of climate change to the poorer and weaker citizens of the world. Second, the present generation is tempted to pass the problem on to future generations. Third, our poor grasp of science, international justice, and the human relationship to nature helps to facilitate inaction. As a result, we are engaging in willful self-deception when the lives of future generations, the world's poor, and even the basic fabric of life on the planet is at stake. We should wake up to this profound ethical failure, Gardiner concludes, and demand more of our institutions, our leaders and ourselves.","price":"$

Hanh\n一九二六年出生於越南中部，十六歲在慈孝寺披剃出家，為臨濟宗第四十二代傳人，隨後赴美研究並教學。一九六○年代越戰期間，禪師秉持「佛教必須入世」的信念，以堅實的修行為基礎，以具足的定力、慈悲與智慧濟世在戰火下煎熬的眾生，戰爭結束代表參加巴黎和談，之後一直留在西方弘法，並定期到世界各地帶領禪修活動。\n一九六七年美國黑人民權領袖小馬丁．路德．金恩提名他角逐諾貝爾和平獎。\n一九八二年他在法國南部建立了「梅村」（Village Des Pruniers）禪修道場，並赴世界各地弘法。\n一九九五年曾到台灣弘法並主持禪七法會。\n當今國際社會中最具宗教影響力的僧人之一，以禪師、詩人、人道主義者聞名於世。\n二○一一年再次受邀來台進行寶島諦聽之旅，包括在花博戶外會場的「百人花博自在行禪」。\n一行禪師通曉越、英、法及中文，除了佛學論述，著有詩集、小說、戲劇、傳記等，迄今有上百本著作，台灣出版品：《生生基督世世佛》、《步步安樂行》、《橘子禪》、《與生命相約》、《你可以不生氣》、《你可以不怕死》、《正念的奇蹟》、《觀照的奇蹟》、《見佛殺佛》、《你可以，愛》、《祈禱的力量》、《一心走路》、《生命真正的力量》、《建設淨土》、《一行禪師說佛陀故事》系列、《會心》、《自在》等二十多部。","summary":"你老是擔憂著事情可能出錯，你害怕說不對、做不好？\n你怕失去這個那個，你怕再好的關係終將分離？\n你老是擔憂著事情可能出錯，你害怕說不對、做不好？\n你怕失去這個那個，你怕再好的關係終將分離？\n請記得，恐懼的情緒就只是情緒，它來，停留一段時間，然後離去。\n你可以好好覺察它，照顧它。\n最慈悲的柔軟語，輕安自在的智慧\n一行禪師寫給每一個不想擔心害怕的人\n人們的擔心害怕，就像父母對子女的擔憂一般，連綿不絕。擔心他吃不飽、穿不暖，擔心他跟不上別人又怕他壓力太大，捧在手心怕他依賴長不大，放了手又時時憂心他被帶壞或傷害。一輩子憂心忡忡，你累了嗎？\n轉化心中的恐懼種子\n在佛教裡，我們說心識就像一塊田地，埋著各式各樣的種子，有慈、悲、喜、捨的種子；也有憤怒、恐懼、焦慮的種子；還有正念種子。把平安、喜悅和慈愛的種子帶到你的意識裡，讓它們形成能量，轉化你心中的恐懼種子。本書提供具體方法：釋放身心恐懼的八項正念修習、呼吸練習、放鬆禪、慈心禪。每刻都是一個機會，讓你與內在和好，重建平安和諧。\n多一點平安，少一點害怕\n每當恐懼、憤怒或妒忌這樣的強烈情緒生起時，我們要去照顧這些負面能量，否則它們就會將我們摧毀。無須以一種能量去對抗另一種能量，我們唯一需要做的是去照顧它們，轉化它們。對待我們的苦惱、痛苦和恐懼，需要抱持一種非暴力的態度。\n通過行禪、坐禪、呼吸、微笑和正念進食來接觸這顆正念種子，正念的能量就會不斷增長。而當我們需要正念能量時，只需碰觸那顆種子，正念能量就會產生，我們就可以用它去擁抱內心的強烈情緒。如此成功地修習一次，當強烈情緒再次生起時，我們就會有多一點的平安，少一點的害怕。\n覺知心中的恐懼，足以令人釋懷。了解恐懼從何而來，就能放下。無有畏懼，心便能輕安自在。","price":"260"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Arthur

正式推出\n★人與人的對話全球串聯中，靈魂的民權運動浪潮因之崛起……\n世界正在改變，但不是表面上看起來的那樣……\n近幾年，世界上發生許多重大的天災人禍，從阿拉伯世界領袖垮台，到造成上萬人受害的嚴重地震海嘯，末世論又蠢蠢欲動。這些災難代表了什麼？\n《與神對話》作者尼爾．唐納．沃許說，這些災難與亂象，不是毀滅的開始，一切只是「寧靜前的風雨」。激烈的動盪中，是要世人藉機了解：人的靈魂與意識狀態，與我們周遭的環境實相息息相關。\n地震，龍捲風，海嘯…是我們創造的？是的。\n全球暖化…是我們創造的？是的。\n倒不是說我們「故意」造成的，是我們「不知不覺」促成的，是我們舊有的集體意識形塑了現存的問題。而現在，正是人類意識與文化內涵「更新版本」的時候了。\n舊版本的人類意識，造成了許多競爭，壓力，恐懼。\n新版本的人類意識應該充滿愛，希望與關懷。\n能夠「更新版本」的關鍵，在於世人必須了解長久以來，舊意識中存有許多錯誤的認定：\n舊版本的人類意識認為，我們是由身體是心智組成的，忽略了其實我們還有靈魂。身體是靈魂的暫居之所，心智是幫助身體執行靈魂意識的工具。我們還敬畏、害怕「神」。認為「神」高高在上，我們不遵守祂的意志，就會受到懲罰。因此我們懷著恐懼過日子，要競爭，要表現好，要盡量上天的獎賞，避免懲罰。\n現在是人類意識轉型的時候了，透過人與人的對話與討論，認知並喚醒我們靈魂真正的本性。尼爾說，靈魂真正的本性是與神合一的，神不會懲罰人，神對人無所求，人在世間是基於愛，是來活出喜悅，創造美好的。因此，要改變世界的面貌，方法不是換一個政治領袖，不是改變經濟體制，而是人們能夠開始重新認識自己的靈魂真正的本性與追求。社會外在的制度結構與面貌，則都只是如實反映人們靈魂狀態而已。\n當一個人進入靈魂的探索，那個人就會改變。\n當一個團體一起進入靈魂的探索，那個團體就會改變。\n當整個社會進入靈魂的探索，整個社會都會改變。\n如此一來，很快的，許多社會的集體文化就會產生轉變，\n接著，整個世界就變了……\n在尼爾的號召下，一場「靈魂的民權運動」於焉展開，在世界各地開始串聯，所有人都可以從問自己七個幾個問題著手：\n1.為什麼69億人追求的東西都一樣？(平安，快樂，幸福，愛….)，而卻常常都實現不了？\n2.關於生命，有沒有我們不知道的事情，而當我們知道之後，會改變一切？\n3.有沒有可能，我們對自己其實不是全然了解，包含自己的生命及生命的目地，一旦了解之後，從此，就會改變我們看到的現實，轉變生命的經驗？\n4.我是誰？\n5.這裡是哪裡？\n6.我在這裡做什麼？\n7.我想要做什麼？\n本書特色\n《與神對話》是新世紀經典，曾經幫助許多追求個人靈修的人找到心靈安定的基礎。\n《與人對話》系列是作者在面對2012這個轉捩點，特別規劃出來為所有一般人所寫，內容更關心現實環境、更入世。除了一般人能讀，尼爾也號召新時代靈修的光行者，把這心靈法門更入世地運用出來，運用在更多層面，甚至協助旁人找到光與愛。\n【與人對話系列規劃】\n第一部

Birds with elegant wings, flowers in full bloom, insects which seem to have escaped a fairytale, dripping icicles, Greek Goddesses, baroque curls and elegant curves are invading the design world. \"Forms with Fantasy\" investigates and interprets this rampant trend for the first time. Over 100 designers illustrate how minimalism is becoming increasingly decorated, how they experiment with lace and cut-out techniques and how old styles can be brought up to date again and again.","price":"386.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["George R.R.

Lisia, a hostling in a secret Varrish breeding facility, completely isolated from society and forced to make pearls - new life - on demand by the military.After defeating Varrish rule, the Gelaming uncover the hidden facility, which has been abandoned by its administrators. Only a group of struggling survivors remain, Lisia and nearly two hundred juveniles.Lisia, suspicious and confused by these unfamiliar hara, is fearful of being evicted from the only home and lifestyle he has ever known, as well as losing custody of his charges. Warily, he forms an alliance with the young Lord Swift Parasiel, newly placed in power, and his illustrious hostling, Cobweb. Together these hara work to correct old wrongs, secure new rights, and challenge a liberation that at times feels more like conquest. The past and the present begin to overlap, as Lisia's chilling history is told through the pages of his diary and he struggles to fight for his future, and the welfare of those in his care.","price":"$ 22.59"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storm, Gertrud

Ypres became a place of horror, heroism, and terrifying new tactics and technologies: poison gas, tanks, mines, air strikes, and the unspeakable misery of trench warfare. Drawing on the journals of the men and women who were there, Winston Groom has penned a breathtaking drama of politics, strategy, and human heart.","price":"USD 14.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Barnstone, Tony (EDT)"],"pubdate":"","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"海外汉学","title":"海外汉学"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2952624\/","id":"2952624","publisher":"Univ Pr of New England","isbn10":"0819512109","isbn13":"9780819512109","title":"Out of the Howling Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2952624","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"192.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["George R.R.

Martin's superb and highly acclaimed epic fantasy A Song of Ice and Fire, the richest, most exotic and mesmerising saga since The Lord of the Rings, continues with A Storm of Swords. There is passion here, and misery and charm, grandeur and squalor, tragedy, nobility and courage. The Seven Kingdoms are divided by revolt and blood feud, and winter approaches like an angry beast. Beyond the Northern borders, wildlings leave their villages to gather in the ice and stone wasteland of the Frostfangs. From there, the renegade Brother Mance Rayder will lead them South towards the Wall. The men of the Night's Watch are ready for the coming of a great cold and the walking corpses that travel with it. But now they face a horde of wildlings twenty-thousand strong -- hungry savage people steeped in the dark magic of the haunted wilderness -- poised to invade the Kingdom of the North where Robb Stark wears his new-forged crown. But Robb's defences are ranged against attack from the South, the land of House Stark's enemies the Lannisters. His sisters are trapped there, dead or likely yet to die, at the whim of the Lannister boy-king Joffrey or his depraved mother Cersei, regent of the Iron Throne. Cersei's ambition is unfettered while the dwarf Tyrion Lannister fights for his life, a victim of treachery. And on the other side of the ocean, the last of the Targaryens rears the dragons she hatched from her husband's funeral pyre. Daenerys Stormborn will return to the land of her birth to avenge the murder of her father, the last Dragon King on the Iron Throne.","price":"£11.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Third Book of the Wraeththu Histories","author":["Storm Constantine"],"pubdate":"2006-06-13","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"英文小说","title":"英文小说"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3506802.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"460","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3506802.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3506802.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3506802.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2965125\/","id":"2965125","publisher":"Tor Books","isbn10":"0765303485","isbn13":"9780765303486","title":"The Ghosts of Blood and Innocence","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2965125","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Darquiel har Aralis lives among the hidden tribe of Olopade, in ignorance of his identity, and as he grows up, Darq realizes he is different from any other har.

The book contains the original Kingdon Ward text and extensive additional material, including a history of the exploration, geography and religious significance of the area and more than 250 colour photographs with detailed captions on the plants of the area, most of which are described by Kingdon Ward in the original text.","price":"USD 75"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Gabriel Garcia Marquez"],"pubdate":"1996-02-29","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"堆積在書架上","title":"堆積在書架上"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1769613\/","id":"1769613","publisher":"Gardners Books","isbn10":"0140157484","isbn13":"9780140157482","title":"Leaf Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1769613","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"95.0"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Theodor Storm"],"pubdate":"June, 2003","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1462670.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":["Katz, Jonathan"],"catalog":"","pages":"112","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s1462670.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s1462670.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1462670.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1449394\/","id":"1449394","publisher":"Hesperus Press","isbn10":"1843910446","isbn13":"9781843910442","title":"The Lake of the Bees","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1449394","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"An old man looks back on his life and remembers Elizabeth - the only woman he ever loved.

His professor, the renowned E. C. Mabie, remarked as he  got up and dismissed the seminar, \"Well, we all have to paint our  nudes!\" Tom's earlier comment in his journal that the play \"is  well-constructed, no social propaganda, and is suitable for the  commercial stage\" seems accurate enough in 1999, but woefully naive deep  in the Depression when the play's sexual explicitness—particularly its  matter-of-fact acceptance of a woman's right to her own  sexuality—would have been seen as not only shocking but also  politically radical. Spring Storm would later be disavowed by the author  as \"simply a study of Sex—a blind animal urge or force (like the  regenerative force of April) gripping four lives and leading them into a  tangle of cruel and ugly relations.\" \n\n But the solid and deft  characterizations of the four young people whose lives intertwine—the  sexually alive Heavenly Critchfield, her earthy lover Dick Miles,  Heavenly's wealthy but tongue-tied admirer Arthur Shannon, and the  repressed librarian Hertha Nielson who loves Arthur—are archetypes of  characters we will meet again and again in the Williams canon. Epic in  scope, a bit melodramatic in execution, tragic in outcome,  Spring Storm   created a wave of excitement among theatre insiders when it was given a  staged reading at The Ensemble Studio Theatre's Octoberfest '96. This  edition has been prepared, with an illuminating introduction, by Dan  Isaac, who initiated the Octoberfest production.","price":"93.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Norman Ollestad"],"pubdate":"2009-6","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4763462.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","ebook_url":"https:\/\/read.douban.com\/ebook\/28414084\/","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4763462.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4763462.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4763462.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3813018\/","id":"3813018","publisher":"","isbn10":"0061766720","isbn13":"9780061766725","title":"Crazy for the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3813018","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"在线阅读本书\n\n   Dad Said     Ollestad, we can do it all. . . .      Why do you make me do this?      Because it's beautiful when it all comes together.       I don't think it's ever beautiful.      One day.      Never.      We'll see, my father said. Vamanos.      From the age of three, Norman Ollestad was thrust into the world of surfing and competitive downhill skiing by the intense, charismatic father he both idolized and resented. While his friends were riding bikes, playing ball, and going to birthday parties, young Norman was whisked away in pursuit of wild and demanding adventures. Yet it were these exhilarating tests of skill that prepared \"Boy Wonder,\" as his father called him, to become a fearless champion--and ultimately saved his life.     Flying to a ski championship ceremony in February 1979, the chartered Cessna carrying Norman, his father, his father's girlfriend, and the pilot crashed into the San Gabriel Mountains and was suspended at 8,200 feet, engulfed in a blizzard. \"Dad and I were a team, and he was Superman,\" Ollestad writes. But now Norman's father was dead, and the devastated eleven-year-old had to descend the treacherous, icy mountain alone.     Set amid the spontaneous, uninhibited surf culture of Malibu and Mexico in the late 1970s, this riveting memoir, written in crisp Hemingwayesque prose, recalls Ollestad's childhood and the magnetic man whose determination and love infuriated and inspired him--and also taught him to overcome the indomitable. As it illuminates the complicated bond between an extraordinary father and his son, Ollestad's powerful and unforgettable true story offers remarkable insight for us all.","ebook_price":"87.33","price":"206.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Memoir","author":["Chen Xuezhao"],"pubdate":"1995-1-12","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"共和国","title":"共和国"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29403230.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":["Caroline Greene","Ti Hua"],"catalog":"","pages":"176","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29403230.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29403230.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29403230.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3810538\/","id":"3810538","publisher":"Routledge","isbn10":"1563245531","isbn13":"9781563245534","title":"Surviving the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3810538","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 47.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Butcher, Jim"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2703740\/","id":"2703740","publisher":"New Amer Library","isbn10":"0451461975","isbn13":"9780451461971","title":"Storm Front","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2703740","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"23.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Fun and Learning with Rhythm and Song","author":["Storms & Hurd"],"pubdate":"1995-3-24","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3528418.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"160","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3528418.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3528418.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3528418.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2810366\/","id":"2810366","publisher":"Hunter House","isbn10":"0897931645","isbn13":"9780897931649","title":"101 Music Games for Children","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2810366","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This lively and imaginative book is being used to help children learn about music and sound while they develop the ability to listen, concentrate, be creative, improvise; and trust one another.

Along for the ride were Joan Baez, Roger McGuinn, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, David Blue, Kinky Friedman, T-Bone Burnett, Allen Ginsberg, Sam Sheppard, Mick Ronson, and dozens more musicians, friends, family and hangers-on. The circus was documented in the film Renaldo and Clara, the live album Hard Rain, and a TV concert special of the same name, while in between the two legs of the tour Dylan released the classic Desire album. It is this period of heightened creativity and personal drama that Dylan-authority, author, and musician Sid Griffin examines in  Shelter from the Storm.

One believes that global warming has nothing to do with hurricane ferocity or frequency; the other believes as fervently that it does; both have staked their reputations on their respective positions.

Yet irony today, in aesthetic, literary and philosophical contexts especially, is often regarded with skepticism - as ungraspable, or elusive to the point of confounding. Countering this tendency, Storm advocates a wide-angle view of this master trope, exploring the ironic in major works by playwrights including Chekhov, Pirandello and Brecht, and in notable relation to well-known representative characters in drama from Ibsen's Halvard Solness to Stoppard's Septimus Hodge and Wasserstein's Heidi Holland. To the degree that irony is existential, its presence in the theatre relates directly to the circumstances and the expressiveness of the characters on stage. This study investigates how these key figures enact, embody, represent and personify the ironic in myriad situations in the modern and contemporary theatre.","series":{"id":"37005","title":"Cambridge Studies in Modern Theatre"},"price":"$ 106.22"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Books, Hephaestus"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s10507287.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"302","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s10507287.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s10507287.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s10507287.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10873575\/","id":"10873575","publisher":"","isbn10":"1243252790","isbn13":"9781243252791","title":"Albums with Cover Art by Storm Thorgerson, Including","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10873575","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Hephaestus Books represents a new publishing paradigm, allowing disparate content sources to be curated into cohesive, relevant, and informative books.

In 2006, Winchester was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Her Majesty the Queen. He resides in western Massachusetts.","summary":"\"Variably genial, cautionary, lyrical, admonitory, terrifying, horrifying and inspiring…A lifetime of thought, travel, reading, imagination and memory inform this affecting account.\"\n—Kirkus Reviews (starred review)\n.\nBlending history and anecdote, geography and reminiscence, science and exposition, the New York Times bestselling author of Krakatoa tells the breathtaking saga of the magnificent Atlantic Ocean, setting it against the backdrop of mankind's intellectual evolution.\n.\nUntil a thousand years ago, no humans ventured into the Atlantic or imagined traversing its vast infinity. But once the first daring mariners successfully navigated to far shores—whether it was the Vikings, the Irish, the Chinese, Christopher Columbus in the north, or the Portuguese and the Spanish in the south—the Atlantic evolved in the world's growing consciousness of itself as an enclosed body of water bounded by the Americas to the West, and by Europe and Africa to the East. Atlantic is a biography of this immense space, of a sea which has defined and determined so much about the lives of the millions who live beside or near its tens of thousands of miles of coast.\n.\nThe Atlantic has been central to the ambitions of explorers, scientists and warriors, and it continues to affect our character, attitudes, and dreams. Poets to potentates, seers to sailors, fishermen to foresters—all have a relationship with this great body of blue-green sea and regard her as friend or foe, adversary or ally, depending on circumstance or fortune. Simon Winchester chronicles that relationship, making the Atlantic come vividly alive. Spanning from the earth's geological origins to the age of exploration, World War II battles to modern pollution, his narrative is epic and awe-inspiring.\n.\nThe definitive biography of the world's most important body of water -- the Atlantic. One hundred and ninety million years ago, the sh ifting of two of the world's tectonic plates led to the creation of an immense chasm. This giant gash in the flanks of the planet slowly opened up and eventually evolved into the most important and most travelled ocean in our world. In this utterly original biography, Simon Winchester explores the life of the Atlantic; it's birth, its relationship with mankind, and what lies in store for it once man has left the stage. He charts the development of the first settlements by the Oceanside -- the communities of Celts and Vikings and whose lives depended on the sea -- and delves into the age of exploration, venturing to forgotten worlds. The building of some of the world's most beautiful port cities -- London, Rio de Janeiro, New York, Casablanca -- is also examined, along with the creation of settlements and colonies in and around the sea. Completely unique and highly readable, Atlantic takes its reader on a wonderful journey through time, along the waves of our planet's most significant ocean.\n.\n【From Publishers Weekly】\n.\nWinchester, bestselling author of The Professor and the Madman, returns to the natural world with his epic new book, a \"biography\" of the Atlantic Ocean, from its origins 370 million years ago through the population of its shores by humanity and their interactions with it. He sees the Atlantic as the vital ingredient in the blooming of Western civilization. He scrutinizes the early explorations from the Vikings and Norsemen through Columbus, detailing the perils of the open sea. With his excellent research and engrossing anecdotes about the ocean as \"a living thing,\" Winchester spotlights its inspiration on poets, painters, and writers in its majestic beauty. Although he does not neglect the chief tragedies of the Atlantic, like the slave trade and the maritime battles, Winchester occasionally flits beelike from scene to scene, and the facts become lost in a blur. Maybe this is the price for such a monumental undertaking. Nevertheless, Winchester's sea saga is necessary reading for those who want to understand the planet better, even as, he notes, our waters are rapidly changing from pollution, overfishing, and climate change. 44 b&w illus.; 4 maps. (Nov.) (c)\nCopyright © PWxyz, LLC. All rights reserved.\n.\n【From Booklist】\n.\nOf all of Winchester’s amazingly educational and entertaining books, a list that includes the best-selling The Map That Changed the World (2001) and Krakatoa (2003), his latest one is perhaps the most unique and the most creative in its approach. It is presented as a biography—of an ocean! It is as if he is telling the life story of the Atlantic, and, indeed, as we learn from one of the most wondrous facts presented here, oceans actually do have life spans—they have “their beginnings and their endings.” The Atlantic, as we are told, was born 10 million years ago by the continental split between Africa and South America, and its death will occur some 170 million years from now. The geological history of this vast body of water is partnered with the human story of habitation around it, and travel over it, because in Winchester’s view, the Atlantic has functioned as the “inland sea of Western civilization.” His coverage of aspects of human involvement with this ocean is lively and extensive, with topics ranging from the Atlantic as represented in the arts to the effects of climate change and overfishing and from immigration patterns to the use of the ocean’s waters for warfare. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Winchester’s latest is bound to follow his previous books onto best-seller lists, and this one should be promoted as one of his best.\n--Brad Hooper\n.\n【Review】\n.\n“Winchester brings a knowledge as vast and deep as his subject to this history of the Atlantic Ocean.”\n--Entertainment Weekly","price":"$ 18.07"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Hans Wijers"],"pubdate":"2012-6","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"二战","title":"二战"},{"count":1,"name":"礼物","title":"礼物"},{"count":1,"name":"感动","title":"感动"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8512756.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"304","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8512756.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8512756.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8512756.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10510951\/","id":"10510951","publisher":"Stackpole Books","isbn10":"0811710890","isbn13":"9780811710893","title":"Winter Storm: The Battle for Stalingrad and the Operation to Rescue 6th Army","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10510951","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Firsthand German accounts from the Battle of Stalingrad  The Battle of Stalingrad began on the 23 August 1942 and did not come to a end until over five months later.

Government policy that pushes the rate below this point--about 6 percent--is apt to trigger an accelerating rate of inflation that is hard to reverse, or so the argument goes. In this book, Storm and Naastepad make a strong case that this concept is flawed: that a stable non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), independent of macroeconomic policy, does not exist. Consequently, government decisions based on the NAIRU are not only misguided but have huge and avoidable social costs, namely, high unemployment and sustained inequality.  Skillfully merging theoretical and empirical analysis, Storm and Naastepad show how the NAIRU's neglect of labor's impact on technological change and productivity growth eclipses the many positive contributions that labor and its regulation make to economic performance. When these positive effects are taken into account, the authors contend, a more humane policy becomes feasible, one that would enhance productivity and technological progress while maintaining profits, thus creating conditions for low unemployment and wider equality.","price":"$ 56.44"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storm,

Flourishing alternative cultures in the latter part of the decade laid many of the foundations of later trends and subcultures and this influence is nowhere more apparent than in record packaging, with classic graphic design and layouts reappearing again and again. This newly reformatted edition of Classic Album Covers of the 60s is a collection of over 200 of the very best (and in some cases worst) that designers had to offer throughout the decade. Representative designs from each period are illustrated in full colour, taking the reader on a journey from the wholesome joviality of the Very Merry Macs and Muscle Beach Party, through stylish and understated jazz cover designs, to the best psychedelic designs of the late 60s such as the Beatles' Sgt Pepper and the Incredible String Band's The 5000 Spirits. The changing style of album cover design illustrated in Classic Album Covers of the 60s provides a fascinating reflection of changing cultural trends during a decade whose ideas and artistic expressions sought to break the prevailing rules and, so doing, laid the foundations for cover design today.","price":"USD 19.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Justine Smith"],"pubdate":"2009-9-3","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"英國","title":"英國"},{"count":2,"name":"繪本","title":"繪本"},{"count":2,"name":"JustineSmith","title":"JustineSmith"},{"count":1,"name":"2000s","title":"2000s"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6520119.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"10","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6520119.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6520119.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6520119.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4098928\/","id":"4098928","publisher":"Ladybird Books","isbn10":"140930180X","isbn13":"9781409301806","title":"Little Penguin and the Big Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4098928","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"£10.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Junger, Sebastian"],"pubdate":"2006-5","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4724872.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"240","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4724872.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4724872.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4724872.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4876899\/","id":"4876899","publisher":"","isbn10":"0007230060","isbn13":"9780007230068","title":"The Perfect Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4876899","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The worst storm in history seem from the wheelhouse of a doomed fishing trawler; a mesmerisingly vivid account of a natural hell from a perspective that offers no escape.  The 'perfect storm' is a once-in-a-hundred-years combination: a high pressure system from the Great Lakes, running into storm winds over an Atlantic island -- Sable Island -- and colliding with a weather system from the Caribbean: Hurricane Grace. This is the story of that storm, told through the accounts of individual fishing boats caught up in the maelstrom, their families waiting anxiously for news of their return, the rescue services scrambled to save them. It is the story of the old battle between the fisherman and the sea, between man and Nature, but here Nature is an awesome and capricious power that transforms the surface of the Atlantic into an impossible tumult of water walls and gaping voids, with the capacity to break an oil tanker in two, let alone the 72ft swordfishing boat Andrea Gail with her crew of eight. A typical Hurricane encompasses a million cubic miles of atmosphere and can contain enough energy to, in theory, meet the electric power needs of the UK for a decade. Except that a hurricane will not be controlled. In spare, lyrical prose 'The Perfect Storm' describes what happened when the Andrea Gail looked into the wrathful face of the perfect storm.","price":"90.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Very Soggy Counting Book","author":["Nancy Tafuri"],"pubdate":"2009-08-25","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4327106.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4327106.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4327106.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4327106.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4558740\/","id":"4558740","publisher":"Simon & Schuster Children's Publishing","isbn10":"1416967958","isbn13":"9781416967958","title":"The Big Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4558740","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"As clouds amass overhead and rain starts to pour, ten little woodland animals hurry to find shelter.

R. Martin is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of many novels, including the acclaimed series A Song of Ice and Fire—A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows, and A Dance with Dragons—as well as Fevre Dream, The Armageddon Rag, Dying of the Light, Windhaven (with Lisa Tuttle), and Dreamsongs Volumes I and II. He is also the creator of The Lands of Ice and Fire, a book of maps from A Song of Ice and Fire featuring original artwork from illustrator and cartographer Jonathan Roberts. As a writer-producer, Martin has worked on The Twilight Zone, Beauty and the Beast, and various feature films and pilots that were never made. He lives with the lovely Parris in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nBiography\nAs a child growing up in New Jersey, George R.R. Martin displayed an early interest in \"the writing life\" by selling monster stories of his own invention to the children in his Bayonne neighborhood. In high school he became an avid comic book collector and began to write for comic fanzines. He sold his first story to Galaxy in 1970 when he was 21 years old.\nMartin received his bachelor's and master's degrees in journalism from Northwestern University. After graduation he served two years in VISTA, then worked as a teacher and chess tournament director in the Midwest, while continuing to craft award-winning short fiction. His first full-length novel, Dying of the Light, was published in 1977. A dark, lyrical sci-fi tone poem set on a doomed world without a sun, the book was nominated for a Hugo Award.\nThroughout the 1980s, Martin worked in television, writing for science fiction- and fantasy-themed shows like The Twilight Zone and Beauty and the Beast. At this time he became involved with Wild Cards, a long-running anthology series composed of \"mosaic stories\" written by multiple authors and set in a shared universe. In addition to editing the series, Martin has contributed stories to the Wild Card books.\nIn 1996, Martin published A Game of Thrones, the first installment of his magnum opus, the epic fantasy series A Song of Fire and Ice. Set in the Seven Kingdoms, a realm resembling medieval Europe, the internationally bestselling series has provided the ultimate showcase for Martin's formidable world-building and characterization skills.\nDuring the course of his long, prolific career, Martin has accrued every major literary prize for science fiction or fantasy writing, including the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Bram Stoker, Daedelus, and Locus awards. But what endears him especially to his readers is his extraordinary accessibility. A tireless participant in genre conventions and festivals, he maintains a cordial relationship with his fans through his website and blog. He is also a member of the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America.","summary":"Here is the third volume in George R. R. Martin's magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R. R. Martin's stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.\nA Storm of Swords\nOf the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King's Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world....\nBut as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others--a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the SevenKingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords. . .","series":{"id":"19299","title":"A Song of Ice and Fire (HBO Tie-in Edition)"},"price":"USD 18.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["BERNARD CORNWELL"],"pubdate":"2015-10-8","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"英国","title":"英国"},{"count":1,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"历史","title":"历史"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28387850.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","ebook_url":"https:\/\/read.douban.com\/ebook\/41435095\/","pages":"320","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s28387850.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s28387850.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28387850.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/20055026\/","id":"20055026","publisher":"HarperCollins","isbn10":"0007504063","isbn13":"9780007504060","title":"Warriors of the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/20055026","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The new novel in Bernard Cornwell’s number one bestselling series on the making of England and the fate of his great hero, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.\nBBC2’s major Autumn 2015 TV show THE LAST KINGDOM is based on the first two books in the series.\nA fragile peace is about to be broken…\nKing Alfred’s son Edward and formidable daughter, Æthelflaed, rule Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia.

Although humans have tried to forecast weather for millennia, mathematical principles were used in meteorology only after the turn of the twentieth century. From the first proposal for using mathematics to predict weather, to the supercomputers that now process meteorological information gathered from satellites and weather stations, Ian Roulstone and John Norbury narrate the groundbreaking evolution of modern forecasting. The authors begin with Vilhelm Bjerknes, a Norwegian physicist and meteorologist who in 1904 came up with a method now known as numerical weather prediction. Although his proposed calculations could not be implemented without computers, his early attempts, along with those of Lewis Fry Richardson, marked a turning point in atmospheric science. Roulstone and Norbury describe the discovery of chaos theory's butterfly effect, in which tiny variations in initial conditions produce large variations in the long-term behavior of a system--dashing the hopes of perfect predictability for weather patterns. They explore how weather forecasters today formulate their ideas through state-of-the-art mathematics, taking into account limitations to predictability. Millions of variables--known, unknown, and approximate--as well as billions of calculations, are involved in every forecast, producing informative and fascinating modern computer simulations of the Earth system. Accessible and timely, Invisible in the Storm explains the crucial role of mathematics in understanding the ever-changing weather.","price":"$ 39.55"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Tenet, George"],"pubdate":"2008-4","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"US","title":"US"},{"count":1,"name":"Politics","title":"Politics"},{"count":1,"name":"CIA","title":"CIA"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4727544.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"608","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4727544.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4727544.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4727544.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4392357\/","id":"4392357","publisher":"","isbn10":"0061147796","isbn13":"9780061147791","title":"At the Center of the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4392357","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"At the Center of the Storm  is a revealing look at the inner workings of the most important intelligence organization in the world during the most challenging times in recent history.

Josephson-Storm is associate professor in and chair of the Department of Religion at Williams College. He is the author of The Invention of Religion in Japan, also published by the University of Chicago Press.","summary":"A great many theorists have argued that the defining feature of modernity is that people no longer believe in spirits, myths, or magic. Jason Ā. Josephson-Storm argues that as broad cultural history goes, this narrative is wrong, as attempts to suppress magic have failed more often than they have succeeded. Even the human sciences have been more enchanted than is commonly supposed. But that raises the question: How did a magical, spiritualist, mesmerized Europe ever convince itself that it was disenchanted?\nJosephson-Storm traces the history of the myth of disenchantment in the births of philosophy, anthropology, sociology, folklore, psychoanalysis, and religious studies. Ironically, the myth of mythless modernity formed at the very time that Britain, France, and Germany were in the midst of occult and spiritualist revivals. Indeed, Josephson-Storm argues, these disciplines’ founding figures were not only aware of, but profoundly enmeshed in, the occult milieu; and it was specifically in response to this burgeoning culture of spirits and magic that they produced notions of a disenchanted world.\nBy providing a novel history of the human sciences and their connection to esotericism, The Myth of Disenchantment dispatches with most widely held accounts of modernity and its break from the premodern past.","price":"USD 96.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Supreme Court in American Politics","author":["Professor David M O'Brien"],"pubdate":"2014-2-3","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"宪法","title":"宪法"},{"count":1,"name":"law","title":"law"}],"origin_title":"10th edition","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28070297.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"459","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s28070297.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s28070297.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28070297.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/26387935\/","id":"26387935","publisher":"W.

There is a mortal wound in the heart of Azeroth, struck by the sword of the fallen titan Sargeras in a final act of cruelty.\nFor Anduin Wrynn, king of Stormwind, and Sylvanas Windrunner, warchief of the Horde and queen of the Forsaken, there is little time to rebuild what remains and even less to mourn what was lost. Azeroth’s devastating wound has revealed a mysterious material known as Azerite. In the right hands, this strange golden substance is capable of incredible feats of creation; in the wrong ones, it could bring forth unthinkable destruction.\nAs Alliance and Horde forces race to uncover the secrets of Azerite and heal the wounded world, Anduin enacts a desperate plan aimed at forging a lasting peace between the factions. Azerite jeopardizes the balance of power, and so Anduin must gain the trust of Sylvanas. But, as ever, the Dark Lady has her own machinations.\nFor peace to be possible, generations of bloodshed and hatred must be brought to an end.

Isaac Cline was one of the era's new men, a scientist who believed he knew all there was to know about the motion of clouds and the behavior of storms. The idea that a hurricane could damage the city of Galveston, Texas, where he was based, was to him preposterous, \"an absurd delusion.\" It was 1900, a year when America felt bigger and stronger than ever before. Nothing in nature could hobble the gleaming city of Galveston, then a magical place that seemed destined to become the New York of the Gulf.\n\nThat August, a strange, prolonged heat wave gripped the nation and killed scores of people in New York and Chicago. Odd things seemed to happen everywhere: A plague of crickets engulfed Waco. The Bering Glacier began to shrink. Rain fell on Galveston with greater intensity than anyone could remember. Far away, in Africa, immense thunderstorms blossomed over the city of Dakar, and great currents of wind converged. A wave of atmospheric turbulence slipped from the coast of western Africa. Most such waves faded quickly. This one did not.\n\nIn Cuba, America's overconfidence was made all too obvious by the Weather Bureau's obsession with controlling hurricane forecasts, even though Cuba's indigenous weathermen had pioneered hurricane science. As the bureau's forecasters assured the nation that all was calm in the Caribbean, Cuba's own weathermen fretted about ominous signs in the sky. A curious stillness gripped Antigua. Only a few unlucky sea captains discovered that the storm had achieved an intensity no man alive had ever experienced.\n\nIn Galveston, reassured by Cline's belief that no hurricane could seriously damage the city, there was celebration. Children played in the rising water. Hundreds of people gathered at the beach to marvel at the fantastically tall waves and gorgeous pink sky, until the surf began ripping the city's beloved beachfront apart. Within the next few hours Galveston would endure a hurricane that to this day remains the nation's deadliest natural disaster. In Galveston alone at least 6,000 people, possibly as many as 10,000, would lose their lives, a number far greater than the combined death toll of the Johnstown Flood and 1906 San Francisco Earthquake.\n\nAnd Isaac Cline would experience his own unbearable loss.\n\nMeticulously researched and vividly written,  Isaac's Storm  is based on Cline's own letters, telegrams, and reports, the testimony of scores of survivors, and our latest understanding of the hows and whys of great storms. Ultimately, however, it is the story of what can happen when human arrogance meets nature's last great uncontrollable force. As such,  Isaac's Storm  carries a warning for our time.","price":"205.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Emma Holly"],"pubdate":"2007-5-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4256088.jpg","binding":"Mass Market Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"272","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4256088.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4256088.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4256088.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2531655\/","id":"2531655","publisher":"Virgin Books","isbn10":"0352341149","isbn13":"9780352341143","title":"Cooking up a Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2531655","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The Coates Inn restaurant in Cape Cod is about to go out of business when its striking owner, Abby, jumps at a stranger’s offer of help – both in her kitchen and her bedroom.

Serge storms.\nThat lovable, under-undermedicated dispenser of truth, justice, and trivia is back with a vengeance. And not a weirdness-laced moment too soon.\nHis cherished home state is about to take a beating, and from far more than the way-too-routine conga line of hurricanes bearing down on the peninsula. Bodies have begun turning up at a disturbing rate, even for Florida, and it looks like a brutal serial killer is on the loose, which highly offends Serge's moral sensibilities and he vows to stop at nothing in his juggernaut to make All Things Right . . . except if he gets bored or distracted by a cool souvenir or . . . or a . . . whatever.\nBut his path won't be obstacle free.\nAgent Mahoney has picked up the scent. The obsessive criminal profiler—just released from a mental hospital where he'd been sent for getting too deep inside Serge's head—is convinced there is no second killer. Serge's personality is simply splitting from decades of burning with incandescent zest for everything under the sun. Then there's Coleman, whose triathlete approach to the sport of polyabuse binging just might derail the mission more than the entire police community put together.\nThe pace picks up.

Two decades ago, Kenzie had to leave New York because of a scandal. He'd been a volunteer at a runawat shelter, and he'd fallen in love with a seventeen-year-old girl--a girl who died while giving birth to Kenzie's daughter. His older brother, Dalton, a lawyer and board member at the shelter, decided to quell the rumors by releasing Kenzie's note of apology to the press. Kenzie's reputation--and the girl's--were destroyed. He has never forgiven his brother. Now it's the eve of Kenzie's seventieth birthday, and a storm is brewing. His beloved daughter, Bree--the child of the scandal--is coming down from New York for his birthday party. But his brother Dalton is coming down, too, to do some legal work for the island's ill-tempered matriarch. Aided and abetted by Dalton's happy-go-lucky stepson, a loutish gardener, a New Age windsurfer, a bumbling bishop, and a bona fide tempest, Kenzie must somehow contrive to reconcile with his brother--and make peace with his past. Infused with humanity, and informed by faith. \"The Storm\" is Frederick Buechner's most captivating novel since \"Godric\"--a richly satisfying contemporary story of fragmented families and love's many mysteries that will move you, makeyou laugh, and fill you with wonder.","price":"110.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Hunter, Erin"],"pubdate":"2004-1","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"童书","title":"童书"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4761271.jpg","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"336","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4761271.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4761271.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4761271.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2391751\/","id":"2391751","publisher":"Harpercollins Childrens Books","isbn10":"0060000058","isbn13":"9780060000059","title":"Rising Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2391751","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Fire alone can save our clan...

According to Milton Viorst, the current conflict is simply the latest round in a 1,400-year struggle between Christianity and Islam, in which the United States became a participant only in the last century.\n\nToday, the Bush Doctrine aims to free the Arab peoples from political oppression and create a democratic Iraq. So why are Arabs, and Iraqis in particular, so suspicious of our efforts? The explanation, Viorst says, is simple: “What the American leadership has miscalculated, or simply dismissed, is Arab nationalism.” In Storm from the East, Viorst offers a balanced, lucid, and vital history of America’s uneasy relationship with the Arab world and argues that brutal conflict in the region will continue until the West, with the United States taking the lead, honors the Arabs’ insistence on deciding their own destiny.\n\nViorst examines the long struggle of the Arab world to overthrow Western hegemony. He explores the Arab experiences with democracy and military despotism; Nasserite socialism in Egypt and Ba’athism in Syria and Iraq; tribal monarchy in Saudi Arabia and Jordan; guerrilla warfare waged by the Palestinians; and, finally, Islamic rebellion culminating in Osama bin Laden’s extremist al-Qaeda. All have the same goal: the liberation of the Arabs from foreign domination.\n\nStorm from the East is a powerful work that, like no other, limns the political, religious, and social roots of Arab nationalism and the present-day unrest in the Middle East.\n\n\n From the Hardcover edition.","series":{"id":"46206","title":"Modern Library Chronicles"},"price":"121.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Hallion, Richard"],"pubdate":"1997-3","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"历史","title":"历史"},{"count":1,"name":"冷战","title":"冷战"},{"count":1,"name":"军事","title":"军事"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8722484.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"383","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8722484.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8722484.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8722484.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2428679\/","id":"2428679","publisher":"Harpercollins","isbn10":"1560987235","isbn13":"9781560987239","title":"Storm over Iraq","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2428679","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"An incisive account of the Persian Gulf War, Storm Over Iraq shows how the success of Operation Desert Storm was the product of two decades of profound changes in the American approach to defense, military doctrine, and combat operations.

Tim Dorsey's sparklingly original debut novel -- Florida Roadkill -- was a hyper, jump-cut, manic black comedy that took Florida Noir to new extremes. Fellow writers and critics were quick to acclaim the bright new talent that created a high-voltage crime tale suffused with blacker-than-black humour and an infectious fascination with Florida's strange beauty. In Florida Roadkill, the strangely lovable homicidal maniac Serge Storms drove a series of stolen cars around Florida in pursuit of five million dollars hidden in the boot of the wrong car, leaving behind him a bewildering trail of bodies. Now, Serge takes up the chase once more, tracking the car and its hidden money to a dilapidated motel in Tampa -- the Hammerhead Ranch Motel.","price":"63.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"2008-02","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"绘本","title":"绘本"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3187995.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3187995.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3187995.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3187995.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3150527\/","id":"3150527","publisher":"Walrus Books","isbn10":"1552852687","isbn13":"9781552852682","title":"Storm Boy","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3150527","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 9.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Bowler, Tim"],"pubdate":"2003-5","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4825868.jpg","binding":"SAL","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"208","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4825868.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4825868.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4825868.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2609872\/","id":"2609872","publisher":"Simon & Schuster","isbn10":"0689845731","isbn13":"9780689845734","title":"Storm Catchers","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2609872","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"\"Tell a soul and she's dead.

Though her power and grace are legendary, not even she can halt her son's disease. Now ensconced in the magnificent old house, forgotten outpost of the Guild, with its disused weathertop, its formal gardens, its long tradition, at least there might come some tranquility to his death.\nThe age of aether still reigns; its pale glow illuminating the land. All bear the mark of aether's strange influence, except the changelings, banished to Einfell, that strange land untouched by the Ages of Industry, that lies uneasy at England's troubled heart. And it is to Einfell that Alice turns in desperation, to plead for her son's life to one who once trusted her, and suffered the consequences.\n\nRalph is cured. Far away from the filth of industrial London, he is drawn away from his family responsibilities to the world of nature and to a fisherman's daughter, Marion Price. Together they plan to run away, to defy the rule of the Guilds, even to change the world and how it understands itself.\n\nBut his mother will not let love stand in the way of her lust for power, nor the very land she professes to love - even if it means plunging England into a long and bloody civil war.\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nStarred Review. In MacLeod's brilliant The Light Ages (2003), the discovery of a substance called aether revolutionized technology, ushering in a Victorian age radically different from our own. Now, a century later, the Age of Light has come to an end in this more tightly plotted sequel. Alice Meynell, Greatgrandmistress of the Guild of Telegraphers, is willing to commit murder to establish her own power and assure the future of her tubercular son, Ralph. To save his life, she makes a deal with the Chosen, magical beings so warped by aether that they can no longer live in human society. As Ralph's health improves, however, he falls in love with Marion Price, a servant girl who eventually bears his child. Alice, acting in what she believes is Ralph's best interests, forces them to separate, secretly sending the baby to live with the Chosen. Years pass, civil war breaks out, and Alice, Ralph and Marion pursue their varied destinies. Full of detailed descriptions of landscapes and complex human feelings, this rich, leisurely novel bears some similarities to the more frenetic fiction of China Miéville, though the author's affinity to A.S. Byatt is even stronger. This is a major work by a master writing at the top of his form. \n\nFrom Booklist\n\nThe successor to the superb Light Ages (2003) depicts MacLeod's alternate Victorian society as more advanced technologically but with magic still strong in it. Alice Meynell, greatmistress of the Telegraphers' Guild, is about ready to turn to magic to save her son and heir, Ralph, from consumption, for all medical remedies have failed. She hopes that the sea air at Invercombe on the west coast of England will help, and she puts even more hope in the magic that may still linger there, centered around a community of changelings. One of those changelings once loved Alice, and a bargain is struck so that Ralph regains health. Consequently, Alice regains the hope of a dynasty. But then Ralph falls in love with a servant girl, and that so threatens his mother's plans that she sets in motion powerful countermagic that in turn threatens the basis of society. MacLeod has again imagined and written superbly, and be it noted that his erotic scenes should be the envy of many of his professional peers.

Martin's superb and highly acclaimed epic fantasy A Song of Ice and Fire, the richest, most exotic and mesmerising saga since The Lord of the Rings, continues with A Storm of Swords. There is passion here, and misery and charm, grandeur and squalor, tragedy, nobility and courage. The Seven Kingdoms are divided by revolt and blood feud, and winter approaches like an angry beast. Beyond the Northern borders, wildlings leave their villages to gather in the ice and stone wasteland of the Frostfangs. From there, the renegade Brother Mance Rayder will lead them South towards the Wall. The men of the Night's Watch are ready for the coming of a great cold and the walking corpses that travel with it. But now they face a horde of wildlings twenty-thousand strong -- hungry savage people steeped in the dark magic of the haunted wilderness -- poised to invade the Kingdom of the North where Robb Stark wears his new-forged crown. But Robb's defences are ranged against attack from the South, the land of House Stark's enemies the Lannisters. His sisters are trapped there, dead or likely yet to die, at the whim of the Lannister boy-king Joffrey or his depraved mother Cersei, regent of the Iron Throne. Cersei's ambition is unfettered while the dwarf Tyrion Lannister fights for his life, a victim of treachery. And on the other side of the ocean, the last of the Targaryens rears the dragons she hatched from her husband's funeral pyre. Daenerys Stormborn will return to the land of her birth to avenge the murder of her father, the last Dragon King on the Iron Throne.","price":"£17.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Larson, Erik"],"pubdate":"2001-11","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s12436377.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"\n      ","pages":"323","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s12436377.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s12436377.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s12436377.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1743449\/","id":"1743449","publisher":"\n      ","isbn10":"0375724753","isbn13":"9780375724756","title":"Isaac's Storm.

The author examines what Chambers is doing to bring the company back to preeminence, and presents lessons for executives hoping to learn how to avoid the fate that befell Cisco.\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nSlater, a biographer of Jack Welch and George Soros, here profiles John Chambers, the leader of Cisco Systems, one of the Internet economy's greatest success stories. The author traces Chambers's rise from a dyslexic West Virginia childhood to the head of what became, at its $500 billion peak, the most highly valuated company in the United States. While a trajectory like that could make one helluva business tycoon biography, Cisco's sharp decline during the recent recession-which occurred just as Slater finished his first draft-made Chambers's success a thing of the past and forced Slater to completely rethink the book. And though the author believes he \"had a better story to tell as a result of Cisco's setback and the early stages of its recovery,\" he never quite integrates the two halves of the tale. Slater provides plenty of detail on the firm's rise, including its strategy of acquiring other technology firms, but fills the sketchy outline of the events that constitute the alleged \"recovery\" with generalities. Slater also repeats phrases, like a magazine headline asking if Chambers is \"the best CEO on earth,\" and his quotes from sources are repetitive and too long. It's easy to understand why Slater wouldn't want to let so much research go to waste, but perhaps he could have gained some perspective on what happened to Cisco and to the economy at large by holding off a while longer. \n\nFrom Library Journal\n\nPrior to the stock market crash in 2000, Cisco Systems was one of the most valuable companies in the country. Slater (Jack Welch & the G.E. Way) writes about the company's rapid rise and sudden fall, focusing on the leadership of John Chambers, who became CEO in 1995. Cisco was founded in 1984 to build routers and switchers, but Chambers oversaw its rapid expansion, fostering its \"focus on the customer\" philosophy and driving Cisco to enter into partnerships with vendors and to acquire a number of companies. The fall came in March 2000, when Cisco was forced to lay off nearly 8000 employees. Throughout, Chambers is presented as a maverick who turned Cisco into a phenomenally successful company but who was reluctant to take responsibility for its decline. The book concludes with Cisco's recovery story and lessons that other executives can learn from Cisco's experience. Recommended for academic, public, and corporate libraries.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Stacey Marien, American Univ., Washington DC \n\nAbout the Author\n\nRobert Slater has written numerous bestselling business books, including Jack Welch and the GE Way and Soros: The Life, Times, and Trading Secrets of the World's Greatest Investor.

No love life to speak of for months, then all at once, every horny creature in the Otherworld wants to get in your pants...   Eugenie Markham is a powerful shaman who does a brisk trade banishing spirits and fey who cross into the mortal world. Mercenary, yes, but a girl's got to eat. Her most recent case, however, is enough to ruin her appetite. Hired to find a teenager who has been taken to the Otherworld, Eugenie comes face to face with a startling prophecy--one that uncovers dark secrets about her past and claims that Eugenie's first-born will threaten the future of the world as she knows it.    Now Eugenie is a hot target for every ambitious demon and Otherworldy ne'er-do-well, and the ones who don't want to knock her up want her dead. Eugenie handles a Glock as smoothly as she wields a wand, but she needs some formidable allies for a job like this. She finds them in Dorian, a seductive fairy king with a taste for bondage, and Kiyo, a gorgeous shape-shifter who redefines animal attraction. But with enemies growing bolder and time running out, Eugenie realizes that the greatest danger is yet to come, and it lies in the dark powers that are stirring to life within her...","price":"$ 7.90"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Dietz, William C."],"pubdate":"2009-4","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4751861.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"304","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4751861.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4751861.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4751861.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4440404\/","id":"4440404","publisher":"","isbn10":"0345508424","isbn13":"9780345508423","title":"Resistance the Gathering Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4440404","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Great Britain. July 1951. \n\nThree years ago, Russia went dark. Nothing got in. Nothing got out. The world assumed it was political strife. But it was the Chimera: voracious extraterrestrial invaders. And in December 1949, they burst across the Russian border and poured into Europe. The luckiest humans died. The less fortunate succumbed to an alien virus–and changed.\nWithin a year, most of Europe had fallen. Only Great Britain, after struggling desperately, had kept the conquerors at bay. But as the Chimera were repelled, they were evolving. Building. Planning.\n\nAmerica. November 1952.\n\nThe Chimera have crossed the Atlantic. Their lightning strikes on American borders are devastating. Cities are lost. Small towns overrun. Citizens transformed into monstrosities. Enter Lieutenant Nathan Hale, U.S. Ranger. A veteran of the Chimeran conflict, he is uniquely immune to the alien virus. And when regular troops can’t stem the Chimeran onslaught, Hale and his special-operations team meet the menace head-on.\n\nBut while they battle the relentless Chimera, deadly power games rage in the White House. And when Hale discovers a far-reaching conspiracy, one with deadly consequences for the human race, his allegiance to country and mankind is stretched to the breaking point.","price":"$ 9.03"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Spurgeon, C.H."],"pubdate":"1997","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"宗教","title":"宗教"},{"count":1,"name":"基督教","title":"基督教"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s19517554.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"153","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s19517554.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s19517554.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s19517554.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3695115\/","id":"3695115","publisher":"Whitaker House","isbn10":"0883684799","isbn13":"9780883684795","title":"Finding Peace in Life's Storms","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3695115","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 9.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Twisted World - The Robots of Danderzei v. 9","author":["Martin Lodewijk"],"pubdate":"2008-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3721534.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3721534.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3721534.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3721534.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3661691\/","id":"3661691","publisher":"Don Lawrence Collection","isbn10":"9088860238","isbn13":"9789088860232","title":"Storm, the Collection","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3661691","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Jeff Smith"],"pubdate":"2006-02","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4846161.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"174","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4846161.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4846161.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4846161.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3560708\/","id":"3560708","publisher":"Perfection Learning","isbn10":"0756969360","isbn13":"9780756969363","title":"Eyes of the Storm (Bone (Graphix Paperback))","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3560708","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"在线阅读本书\n\n In \"Eyes of the Storm,\" volume three of the nine-book BONE saga, Lucius, Smiley, and Phoney survive an attack by the rat creatures and return safely to Lucius' tavern in Barrelhaven.

In Rain Storn, Rain has fled to Brazil to escape the killing business and the enemies who have been encircling him. But his knack for making death seem to have been of \"natural causes\" and his ability to operate unnoticed in Asia continue to create unwelcome demand for his services. His old employer, the CIA, persuades him to take on a high-risk assignment: a ruthless arms dealer supplying criminal groups throughout Southeast Asia. The upside? Financial, of course, along with the continued chimera of moral redemption. But first, Rain must survive the downside: a second assassin homing in on the target; the target's consort--an alluring woman named Delilah with an agenda of her own; and the possibility that the entire mission is nothing but an elaborate setup. From the gorgeous beaches of Rio to the glitzy casinos of Macao to the gritty back streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon, Rain becomes a reluctant player in an international game far deadlier and more insidious than he has ever encountered before.","price":"USD 7.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Kistner, Manuela"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7591717.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"28","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7591717.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7591717.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7591717.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3319381\/","id":"3319381","publisher":"","isbn10":"3640145542","isbn13":"9783640145546","title":"Gedichte und Symbole in Theodor Storms Immensee","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3319381","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"10,99 EUR"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storm Constantine"],"pubdate":"2001-12-30","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"英文小说","title":"英文小说"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4709493.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"566","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4709493.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4709493.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4709493.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2672911\/","id":"2672911","publisher":"Stark House Press","isbn10":"0966784839","isbn13":"9780966784831","title":"Sign for the Sacred","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2672911","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 24.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Lackey, Mercedes"],"pubdate":"1997-10","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"magic","title":"magic"},{"count":1,"name":"Valdemar","title":"Valdemar"},{"count":1,"name":"TheMageStorms","title":"TheMageStorms"},{"count":1,"name":"SF\/F","title":"SF\/F"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6317895.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"464","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6317895.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6317895.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6317895.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2673512\/","id":"2673512","publisher":"New Amer Library","isbn10":"0886777550","isbn13":"9780886777555","title":"Storm Breaking","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2673512","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"After his wife's untimely death, a powerful sorcerer dedicates his life to seeking revenge against all womankind.

Unfortunately, this silence has seemingly made it easy to dismiss Kaufman in favor of self-promoting Beats such as Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac. A growing number of scholars, however, are taking the time to reexamine the poetry of Bob Kaufman. As they do, they propose various explanations for his silence, which infects both his poetry and his biography. This book offers a new theory. It argues for a historical reading. It posits that Kaufman uses silence to respond to the oppressive conformity of the mid-twentieth century. By remaining obscure, Kaufman rejects the suburban middle-class value system of the time and prohibits the reader from placing him within taxonomies based on class, race, and gender. As such, Kaufman forces the reader to start from scratch when asking questions about identity. Jazz, then, becomes the ideal tool for Kaufman because it works through spontaneity and improvisation and the defeat of embedded forms and structures.","price":"$ 72.32"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Christine Leeson"],"pubdate":"2009-6-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21276039.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s21276039.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s21276039.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21276039.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10831359\/","id":"10831359","publisher":"Little Tiger Press","isbn10":"1845068114","isbn13":"9781845068110","title":"Molly and the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10831359","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP 4.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Christine Leeson"],"pubdate":"2003-12-24","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"绘本","title":"绘本"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21355979.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s21355979.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s21355979.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21355979.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10831360\/","id":"10831360","publisher":"Little Tiger Press","isbn10":"1854308548","isbn13":"9781854308542","title":"Molly and the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10831360","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP 4.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Riedy, Chris"],"pubdate":"","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"气候","title":"气候"},{"count":1,"name":"climate","title":"climate"},{"count":1,"name":"change","title":"change"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7602560.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"524","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7602560.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7602560.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7602560.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10325422\/","id":"10325422","publisher":"","isbn10":"3836429276","isbn13":"9783836429276","title":"The Eye of the Storm - An Integral Perspective on Sustainable Development and Climate Change Response","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10325422","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Climate change is increasingly recognised as the greatest threat to human and ecological sustainability in the 21st Century. Governments, businesses, non-government organisations and concerned individuals are urgently seeking the right set of responses to avoid dangerous climate change. Most of the proposed solutions focus on systemic changes in technology, markets and institutions. Very few proposals grapple with the critical task of understanding how individual values and shared worldviews contribute to climate change. This book uses an emerging framework called Integral Theory to structure a comprehensive analysis of the exterior and interior dimensions of climate change. Using a case study on Australian energy and greenhouse policy, the book introduces Integral Theory and tests its value as a tool for understanding the hidden dimenions of our sustainability challenges and identifying new ways to respond. The book will be of great interest to those that are seeking to apply Integral Theory, particularly in the area of sustainability. It will also be of interest to anyone concerned with sustainability or climate change and seeking a foundation for a broader response.","price":"$ 31.64"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Gates, Don; Kaluta, Michael Wm;"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7552272.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"176","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7552272.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7552272.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7552272.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10222358\/","id":"10222358","publisher":"","isbn10":"1613420234","isbn13":"9781613420232","title":"Challenger Storm - Isle of Blood","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10222358","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 19.15"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nelson, John Allen"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8384003.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8384003.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8384003.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8384003.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10224718\/","id":"10224718","publisher":"","isbn10":"1616576677","isbn13":"9781616576677","title":"Storms of My Grandchildren","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10224718","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 79.09"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Paul Bright"],"pubdate":"2009-7","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s11105711.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s11105711.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s11105711.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s11105711.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10766285\/","id":"10766285","publisher":"","isbn10":"1845067649","isbn13":"9781845067649","title":"Bears in the Bed and the Great Big Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10766285","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"55.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A New History of the Second World War","author":["Andrew Roberts"],"pubdate":"2012-5-29","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24233006.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"800","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s24233006.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s24233006.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24233006.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/11027370\/","id":"11027370","publisher":"Harper Perennial","isbn10":"0061228605","isbn13":"9780061228605","title":"The Storm of War","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/11027370","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 19.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Andrews, Virginia"],"pubdate":"2010-11","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6741649.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"388","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6741649.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6741649.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6741649.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6689252\/","id":"6689252","publisher":"","isbn10":"1451631812","isbn13":"9781451631814","title":"Eye of the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6689252","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"In the wake of a terrible loss, Rain is left alone to bear the Hudson family secreets -- as dark and forbidding as storm clouds on the horizon...

Left helpless after a devastating blow, Rain sinks into despair as her precious dreams are washed away...dreams that cannot be bought with the Hudson fortune.

This one was naked, covered with a glaze of ice. Even the long black hair that fell in tendrils across her face was encased in ice. It was as if she were under a spell–the victim of a jealous wizard, a wicked witch.  [ The Delicate Storm , page 164]\n  \n  Algonquin Bay is wrapped in a thick blanket of fog; an eerie prophecy of weather on its way, or perhaps something more ominous. When a local man discovers a dismembered arm in his front yard, it seems that the long fingers of fog that strangle the city are also hiding a grisly secret. While at first the discovery is thought to be the work of ravenous bears, woken early from their long winter hibernation, the coroner later confirms that the victim was actually sawn into pieces rather torn. The case becomes even murkier when a local trapper confesses to cutting up the body and scattering the remains but claims to be innocent of committing the murder.\n\nDetectives John Cardinal and Lise Delorme have their work cut out for them. After identifying the victim as Howard Matlock, New York city resident, a new player enters the ring: the RCMP. In any case involving an American, the RCMP shares jurisdiction with the Algonquin Bay Police Department and that means Corporal Malcolm Musgrave. A blustering wall of self-importance and attitude, Musgrave has Cardinal bristling, and he reminds Delorme of a betrayal she’d rather forget. To add insult to injury, Delorme is pulled off the case and Cardinal ends up in a partnership not only with Musgrave, but with the unbearably obsequious Calvin Squier, an agent of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).\n\nWhen Cardinal makes the surprising discovery that Howard Matlock is alive and well, he begins to suspect that not everyone involved in the case is working towards the same goal. The body parts add up to one Miles Shakeley, a CIA operative in Montreal in 1970, and Cardinal becomes suspicious that CSIS is somehow involved.\n\nMeanwhile, the case of a missing woman in Algonquin Bay is occupying Delorme. When the body of Dr. Winter Cates is uncovered in a glaze of ice, Delorme is convinced that a jealous boyfriend is to blame. But when blood evidence bonds Cardinal and Delorme’s cases, they are back together and travelling to Montreal to track down tenuous leads. And it is there that they discover that their cases reach far beyond the town limits of Algonquin Bay. Untangling the secrets of a government in crisis, cover-ups, and the meddling of American intelligence agencies, they are eventually led back to where they started–and to a suspect who is untouchable.--From the Hardcover edition.","price":"130.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Gemmell, David"],"pubdate":"1999-8","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6838727.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"480","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6838727.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6838727.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6838727.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6766505\/","id":"6766505","publisher":"","isbn10":"0552142565","isbn13":"9780552142564","title":"Sword in the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6766505","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Born in the storm that doomed his father, Connavar grows to manhood among the mist-covered mountains of Caer Druagh, where the Rigante tribe dwell in harmony with the land and its gods.

So write Lin and Larry Pardey in this, the third edition of their highly regarded Storm Tactics Handbook. As in the first two editions of this book, they describe their concerns about the tendency of modern sailors to discard the classic methods used to bring sailing vessels of all sizes from vast clipper ships to tiny yachts through amazingly strong winds and heavy seas. There is only one storm tactic that has the ability to sap the power of breaking seas, they explain. With clear and concise diagrams, they proceed to show how heaving-to works and how even the most modern of yachts can be made to heave-to, whether with only sail power or with the assistance of a sea anchor. A discussion of the many ways heaving-to can be useful at sea as a way to help the crew keep well rested, to effect repairs, to steady a vessel should outside assistance ever be necessary will convince even those who plan to run before their imagined ultimate storm that heaving-to is still a must know.     A series of user-friendly checklists will help sailors from the moment they start looking for their perfect offshore boat, through outfitting, and as they encounter their first storms at sea. Highly readable stories of the Pardeys encounters with storms, and of experiences related by several other modern sailors, help illustrate and expand the points made in this book.    Since writing the previous edition of Storm Tactics Handbook, Lin and Larry have voyaged an additional 35,000 miles. This has taken them as far north as Norway, twice across the Atlantic, south to Argentina, into the Pacific, around Cape Horn against the prevailing winds, and then on a circuit of the North Pacific. With insights gained from these recent voyages, they have fully revised and expanded this text by more than 40 percent, including nine completely new chapters. New material includes:    Lessons from Cape Horn   An interview with the late Sir Peter Blake, on storm survival and heaving-to    Heaving-to using a Galerider on 55-foot Morgan s Cloud   Adding rudder protection stops    Discussions on avoiding chafe, building and using storm staysails, choosing storm gear, deploying para-anchors, avoiding the worst areas of cyclonic storms, and many more have been expanded to answer many questions posed by readers and seminar attendees.

Her initiation rite, though it follows the traditional pattern of thousands of others, is different in one vital respect. The guardian-pursuers that are invoked to watch over Rayojini's progress are real. In far off Sacramante, the artisans who are patronised by the upper echelons of Bochanegran society, live in isolated atelier courts. The public may watch performances at chosen times, but only the patron families have constant access to the astounding creations of the eloim artists. The eloim themselves are more than content to remain a race apart, for so they are, and if the majority were to know their true nature, their lives would be forfeit. After eons of contented cohabitation, a phenomenon known as the Fear is beginning to infect the eloim, who have previously considered themselves free from the petty psychological problems of humanity. They have been virtually immortal - thanks to the protection of the patrons, who exchange their life's blood for culture - but now the artisans are beginning to die in despair. Gimel and Beth Metatronim, an actress and a painter, set out to find a Tappish soulscaper, who will be proficient enough to enter the racial soulscape of the eloim, track down the cause of the Fear and eradicate it. The soulscape of their choice, Rayojini, is puzzled that her guardian pursuers should be so much more real than those of other soulscapers. Then, as she delves deeper into the cause of the terrible 'non-death', a mysterious affliction akin to the Fear, their attentions become unavoidable.","price":"USD 21.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Larry Hama","Russ Heath"],"pubdate":"2009-7-21","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5583192.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"152","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5583192.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5583192.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5583192.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6056219\/","id":"6056219","publisher":"IDW Publishing","isbn10":"1600104711","isbn13":"9781600104718","title":"G.I.

Braid weaves an intimate dynamic as K struggles with the loss of her hearing in one ear, finding her greatest comfort in Gould's music - particularly when he plays Bach. Gould's poems don't directly reply, but they do echo a response as he struggles with his own difficult life; his family, his health, his strong beliefs in how music should be presented and his personal habits considered 'eccentric' by an ever-watchful press.K starts to accept her changing world, just as Gould begins a downward spiral into disintegration. In his final reflection, Gould acknowledges that in spite of his personal trials, his music now circles the world in the spacecraft Voyager as Earth's example to other possible life forms of what is most beautiful in this civilisation. This is a striking and masterful volume of poems that does justice to Gould's brilliance, offering insights into his personal life and art, even as it showcases Braid's own virtuosity.","price":"$ 19.15"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Gray, C K"],"pubdate":"2010-5","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4837998.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"190","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4837998.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4837998.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4837998.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6055164\/","id":"6055164","publisher":"","isbn10":"0741460181","isbn13":"9780741460189","title":"Eye of the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6055164","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Seventeen-year-old Eliza Anceaux finds her soul mate in handsome John Barrett.

That's taught as fact in psychology textbooks, academic journals, and bestselling books. And these hardwired differences explain everything from sexual orientation to gender identity, to why there aren't more women physicists or more stay-at-home dads. In this compelling book, Rebecca Jordan-Young takes on the evidence that sex differences are hardwired into the brain. Analyzing virtually all published research that supports the claims of 'human brain organization theory,' Jordan-Young reveals how often these studies fail the standards of science. Even if careful researchers point out the limits of their own studies, other researchers and journalists can easily ignore them because brain organization theory just sounds so right. But if a series of methodological weaknesses, questionable assumptions, inconsistent definitions, and enormous gaps between ambiguous findings and grand conclusions have accumulated through the years, then science isn't scientific at all.  Elegantly written, this book argues passionately that the analysis of gender differences deserves far more rigorous, biologically sophisticated science. 'The evidence for hormonal sex differentiation of the human brain better resembles a hodge-podge pile than a solid structure...Once we have cleared the rubble, we can begin to build newer, more scientific stories about human development.'","price":"USD 35.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Timmer, Reed"],"pubdate":"2010-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7700066.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7700066.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7700066.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7700066.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5487088\/","id":"5487088","publisher":"","isbn10":"0525951938","isbn13":"9780525951933","title":"Into the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5487088","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Reed Timmer, a star of the top rated  Storm Chasers  on the Discovery Channel is one of the most successful and most extreme storm chasers in the world.

By using a novel comparative perspective it gives a fresh view of the relationship between cultural regionalism, political regionalism and nationalism. Storm further illuminates how during the first decades of the twentieth century the culture of regionalism slowly lost the battle against its main rival: the avant-garde. Regional identities, like national identities, were created and sometimes even invented; and this was equally the case in France, Germany and Spain. Artists, architects and international exhibitions played a highly influential role in this process. They all appropriated, and in some cases perverted, the regionalist message showing that strong regional identities would ultimately reinforce national unity.

Even after two decades of volatile marriage, Katharine still believes she can have the life that she felt promised to her by those first exhilarating days with her husband, Frederick. For two months, just before Frederick left to fight in World War II, Katharine received his total attentiveness, his limitless charms, his astonishing range of intellect and wit. Over the years, however, as Frederick’s behavior and moods have darkened, Katharine has covered for him, trying to rein in his great manic passions and bridge his deep wells of sadness: an unending project of keeping up appearances and hoping for the best. But the project is failing. Increasingly, Frederick’s erratic behavior, amplified by alcohol, distresses Katharine and their four daughters and gives his friends and family cause to worry for his sanity. When, in the summer of 1962, a cocktail party ends with her husband in handcuffs, Katharine makes a fateful decision: She commits Frederick to Mayflower Home, America’s most revered mental asylum.\n\nThere, on the grounds of the opulent hospital populated by great poets, intellectuals, and madmen, Frederick tries to transform his incarceration into a creative exercise, to take each meaningless passing moment and find the art within it. But as he lies on his room’s single mattress, Frederick wonders how he ever managed to be all that he once was: a father, a husband, a business executive. Under the faltering guidance of a self-obsessed psychiatrist, Frederick and his fellow patients must try to navigate their way through a gray zone of depression, addiction, and insanity.\n\nMeanwhile, as she struggles to raise four young daughters, Katharine tries to find her way back to Frederick through her own ambiguities, delusions, and the damages done by her rose-colored belief in a life she no longer lives. \n\nInspired by elements of the lives of the author’s grandparents, this haunting love story shifts through time and reaches across generations. Along the way, Stefan Merrill Block stunningly illuminates an age-old truth: even if one’s daily life appears ordinary, one can still wage a silent, secret, extraordinary war.","price":"CDN$ 28.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Three","author":["Martin, George R.

Martin is best known for his epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire.\nBiography\nAs a child growing up in New Jersey, George R.R. Martin displayed an early interest in \"the writing life\" by selling monster stories of his own invention to the children in his Bayonne neighborhood. In high school he became an avid comic book collector and began to write for comic fanzines. He sold his first story to Galaxy in 1970 when he was 21 years old.\nMartin received his bachelor's and master's degrees in journalism from Northwestern University. After graduation he served two years in VISTA, then worked as a teacher and chess tournament director in the Midwest, while continuing to craft award-winning short fiction. His first full-length novel, Dying of the Light, was published in 1977. A dark, lyrical sci-fi tone poem set on a doomed world without a sun, the book was nominated for a Hugo Award.\nThroughout the 1980s, Martin worked in television, writing for science fiction- and fantasy-themed shows like The Twilight Zone and Beauty and the Beast. At this time he became involved with Wild Cards, a long-running anthology series composed of \"mosaic stories\" written by multiple authors and set in a shared universe. In addition to editing the series, Martin has contributed stories to the Wild Card books.\nIn 1996, Martin published A Game of Thrones, the first installment of his magnum opus, the epic fantasy series A Song of Fire and Ice. Set in the Seven Kingdoms, a realm resembling medieval Europe, the internationally bestselling series has provided the ultimate showcase for Martin's formidable world-building and characterization skills.\nDuring the course of his long, prolific career, Martin has accrued every major literary prize for science fiction or fantasy writing, including the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Bram Stoker, Daedelus, and Locus awards. But what endears him especially to his readers is his extraordinary accessibility. A tireless participant in genre conventions and festivals, he maintains a cordial relationship with his fans through his website and blog. He is also a member of the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America.","summary":"Here is the third volume in George R. R. Martin's magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R. R. Martin's stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.\nA Storm of Swords\nOf the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King's Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world....\nBut as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others--a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the SevenKingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords. . .","price":"£ 25.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["White, Rowland"],"pubdate":"2012-5","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24568817.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"544","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s24568817.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s24568817.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24568817.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/11617323\/","id":"11617323","publisher":"","isbn10":"0552160210","isbn13":"9780552160216","title":"Storm Front","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/11617323","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"In early 1970, the Commanding Officer of 22 SAS flew into the strategically critical Sultanate of Oman on a covert intelligence mission to monitor a Communist rebellion threatening the Arabian Peninsula.

But for the British soldiers and airmen, it was to be no easy victory. And despite confronting the largest assault force ever deployed by the SAS, many months later the enemy were still far from beaten. Something had to give. Then at dawn on July 19th, 1972, and without warning, a force of nearly 300 heavily armed, well-trained guerillas attacked the little fishing port of Mirbat. Between them and glory stood a team of just nine SAS men, aided only by the skill of the fighter pilots overhead. It was to be an epic encounter; a modern day Rorke's Drift.

Her ballsy, heartbreaking, hysterical, tour de force of a memoir is not to be missed.  Crazy Enough  is vulgar and fragile, tragic and empowering, and like Storm, it is always entertaining” (Chelsea Cain,  New York Times  bestselling author of  Heartsick  and  The Night Season ).  Storm spent most of her childhood visiting her mother in mental institutions and psych wards. One day, nine-year-old Storm jokingly asked one of her mother’s doctors, “I’m not going to be crazy like that, right?” To which he replied, “Well, yes. It’s hereditary. You absolutely will end up like your mother. But not until your twenties.”  Desperate to delay the lonely sickness and sadness that haunted her mother, Storm stomped her size-twelve boots straight toward as much sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll as she could find. She sprinted through her young life, trying to stave off the madness she feared would catch up to her at any moment. Instead, she found herself deep in a life of craziness of her own making.  Then, in her twenties, with nothing to live for and a growing heroin addiction, Storm accepted a chance invitation to sing with a friend’s band. That night she reconnected with her long-term love of music, and it dragged her back from the edge. She has been singing and slinging inappropriate banter at audiences worldwide ever since.   With tremendous honesty and tremendously dirty language,  Crazy Enough  is about an artist’s journey of realizing that the mistakes that make, break, and remake us are worth far more than our flailing attempts to live a life we think is “normal.”","price":"$ 15.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Japan's Top Secret Submarines and Its Plan to Change the Course of World War II","author":["John Geoghegan"],"pubdate":"2013-3-19","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29240099.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"496","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29240099.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29240099.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29240099.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/20004780\/","id":"20004780","publisher":"Crown","isbn10":"0307464806","isbn13":"9780307464804","title":"Operation Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/20004780","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The riveting true story of Japan's top secret plan to change the course of World War II using a mammoth submarine a generation ahead of its time.  In 1941, the architects of Japan's sneak attack on Pearl Harbor planned a bold follow-up: a classified program to build a fleet of underwater aircraft carriers designed to launch a surprise and potentially devastating attack-this time against New York City and Washington, DC. Japan built this fleet of top secret submarines-the Sen-toku or I-400 class of subs-which were, by far, the largest and among the most advanced subs of World War II. This entire operation was unknown to US intelligence, despite having broken the Japanese naval code. And the amazing thing is how close the Japanese came to pulling off their mission. Meticulously researched and masterfully told, Operation Storm tells the fascinating story of the Sen-toku, their desperate push into Allied waters, and the dramatic chase of this juggernaut sub by the US Navy.","price":"USD 28.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Rosenthal, Rachel; Chaudhuri, Una; Chaudhuri, Una"],"pubdate":"2001-10","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"艺术史","title":"艺术史"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s13014392.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"232","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s13014392.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s13014392.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s13014392.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/12456641\/","id":"12456641","publisher":"","isbn10":"0826448968","isbn13":"9780826448965","title":"Rachel's Brain and Other Storms","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/12456641","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Rachel Rosenthal is an internationally recognised pioneer in the field of feminist and ecological performance art.

For the early settlers the sight of a funnel cloud was an unearthly event.

In  Storm Kings,  Lee Sandlin explores America’s fascination with and unique relationship to tornadoes. From Ben Franklin’s early experiments to the “great storm war” of the nineteenth century to heartland life in the early twentieth century, Sandlin re-creates with vivid descriptions some of the most devastating storms in America’s history, including the Tri-state Tornado of 1925 and the Peshtigo “fire tornado,” whose deadly path of destruction was left encased in glass.\n\nDrawing on memoirs, letters, eyewitness testimonies, and archives, Sandlin brings to life the forgotten characters and scientists who changed a nation—including James Espy, America’s first meteorologist, and Colonel John Park Finley, who helped place a network of weather “spotters” across the country. Along the way, Sandlin details the little-known but fascinating history of the National Weather Service, paints a vivid picture of the early Midwest, and shows how successive generations came to understand, and finally coexist with, the spiraling menace that could erase lives and whole towns in an instant.","price":"$ 30.45"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A History of Trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933-1945","author":["Rolf Giesen","J.

If the SAS had been defeated at Mirbat, the Russian and Chinese plan for a communist foothold in the Middle East would have succeeded, with catastrophic consequences for the oil-hungry West. SAS OPERATION STORM is a page-turning account of courage and resilience. Mirbat was a battle fought and won by nine SAS soldiers and a similar number of brave local people - some as young as ten years old - outnumbered by at least twenty-five to one. Roger Cole, one of the SAS soldiers who took part, and writer Richard Belfield have interviewed every SAS survivor who fought in the battle from the beginning to the end - the first time every single one of them has revealed their experience. SAS OPERATION STORM is a classic story of bravery against impossible odds, minute by minute, bullet by bullet.","price":"GBP 10.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storm, Marvin L."],"pubdate":"2008-3","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24330498.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"274","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s24330498.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s24330498.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24330498.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/12571263\/","id":"12571263","publisher":"","isbn10":"0979100410","isbn13":"9780979100413","title":"Transitioning from Employee to Entrepreneur - A Road Map for Aspiring Entrepreneurs","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/12571263","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 28.19"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Martin, George R.

For around two centuries they were the dominant soldiers of the Classical world, in great demand as mercenaries throughout the Mediterranean and Middle East. Yet, despite the battle descriptions of Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon etc, and copious evidence of Greek art and archaeology, there are still many aspects of hoplite warfare that are little

Much of the information contained in the profiles of the individual institutions may be found in the Interna tional Handbook of Universities (Internat. Assn. of Universities, 1991. 12th ed.). However, this guide expands on these profiles and features a valuable, detailed narrative section for 11 Western European countries.

He is Member of Parliament for Twickenham and has been the Liberal Democrats' main economic spokesperson since 2003, having previously served as Chief Economist for the oil company Shell from 1995 to 1997. He was elected as deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Commons in March, 2006. He was acting leader of the Liberal Democrats on 15 October 2007 following Sir Menzies Campbell's resignation, but announced soon after that he would not be a candidate in the leadership election.","summary":"In his number 1 hardback bestseller, Vince Cable, 'the stage of the credit crunch' (\"Daily Telegraph\") explains how we got in to this mess and what it means. In \"The Storm\", Vincent Cable explains the causes of the world economic crisis and how we should respond to the challenges it brings. He shows that although the downturn is global, the complacency of the British government towards the huge 'bubble' in property prices and high levels of personal debt, combined with increasingly exotic and opaque trading within the financial markets, has left Britain badly exposed. Yet we need to be vigilant in our response to the dangers confronting us. Times of crises inevitably bring forth false prophets who offer easy panaceas and identify scapegoats. However, Cable shows that an insular response to the current crisis would be a disaster and urges us to resist the siren voices that promote isolationism and nationalism as the answer to economic woes. He argues that policy makers must keep their faith in liberal markets if the remarkable advances in living standards, which are now being extended to the world's poorer countries, are to be maintained.","price":"$ 15.76"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Flanagan, John A."],"pubdate":"2010-2","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":1,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":1,"name":"犯罪","title":"犯罪"},{"count":1,"name":"推理","title":"推理"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4778706.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"391","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4778706.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4778706.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4778706.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4870472\/","id":"4870472","publisher":"","isbn10":"0425235254","isbn13":"9780425235256","title":"Storm Peak","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4870472","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The debut of a brand-new mystery series from the  New York Times  bestselling author of the Ranger's Apprentice novels.   \n\n Ex-Denver police detective Jesse Parker has returned home to Steamboat Springs, Colorado, to spend the winter working ski patrol and forgetting about his past.

Thriller. Gripping historical fiction. This artful, sparely told graphic novel — a tale of a boy in Dust Bowl America — will resonate with young readers today. \n\nIn Kansas in the year 1937, eleven-year-old Jack Clark faces his share of ordinary challenges: local bullies, his father’s failed expectations, a little sister with an eye for trouble. But he also has to deal with the effects of the Dust Bowl, including rising tensions in his small town and the spread of a shadowy illness. Certainly a case of \"dust dementia\" would explain who (or what) Jack has glimpsed in the Talbot’s abandoned barn — a sinister figure with a face like rain. In a land where it never rains, it’s hard to trust what you see with your own eyes — and harder still to take heart and be a hero when the time comes. With phenomenal pacing, sensitivity, and a sure command of suspense, Matt Phelan ushers us into a world where desperation is transformed by unexpected courage.","price":"USD 24.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Napier, William"],"pubdate":"2010-6","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4747059.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"336","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4747059.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4747059.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4747059.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4936212\/","id":"4936212","publisher":"","isbn10":"0312598998","isbn13":"9780312598990","title":"Attila the Gathering of the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4936212","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The second novel in Napier's internationally bestselling acclaimed trilogy","price":"$ 19.20"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Soviet March On Germany, 1945","author":["Christopher Duffy"],"pubdate":"1993-3-22","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"二战","title":"二战"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29956879.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"420","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29956879.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29956879.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29956879.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4344986\/","id":"4344986","publisher":"Da Capo Press","isbn10":"0306805057","isbn13":"9780306805059","title":"Red Storm On The Reich","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4344986","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"On the night of January 11, 1945, fog, low clouds, and blizzards reduced visibility at times to literally zero along the Sandomierz bridgehead.  So the German troops did not notice tanks, assault guns, and towed artillery pieces moving in position by the thousands along the east bankthe Russian sideof the Vistula River.  Within seconds after the order to fire was given by the Soviet commander, General Konev, the air became incandescent with unnatural light.  A sky of fire and smoke lowered over the country across the river: Houses flared up like torches, bunkers collapsed, roads were broken up, and men were ripped apart.  The ferocity of the first attack shook the Germans so badly that they thought they were dealing with the main assault, and not just a reconnaissance in force.  So they were completely unprepared for the principal attack and the horrors it held.  Thus began the Red Storm on the Reichthe largest, costliest, and fastestmoving military operation in European history. \"Essentially, the Second World War was won and lost on the Eastern Front,\" writes renowned historian Christopher Duffy. Until this book, however, the most dramatic events surrounding this part of the war have been little understood.  Utilizing a wealth of recently released Soviet materials from Moscow archives, and cross-referencing these with German accounts, Duffy has uncovered a military campaign of unprecedented scale and intensity during which thirty million lives were lost.  Red Storm on the Reich brings to life not only the Russian military assault on Germany, but also the human drama behind the epic sieges of Danzig, Kolberg, and Breslau.  Duffy's gripping narrative is essential reading for all those interested in modern European history.","price":"GBP 10.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Tenet, George"],"pubdate":"2007-5","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7985089.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7985089.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7985089.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7985089.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4358472\/","id":"4358472","publisher":"","isbn10":"006115086X","isbn13":"9780061150869","title":"At the Center of the Storm CD","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4358472","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"In the whirlwind of accusations and recriminations that emerged in the wake of 9\/11 and the Iraq war, one man's vital testimony has been conspicuously absent. Candid and gripping,  At the Center of the Storm  recounts George Tenet's time at the Central Intelligence Agency, a revealing look at the inner workings of the most important intelligence organization in the world during the most challenging times in recent history. With unparalleled access to both the highest echelons of government and raw intelligence from the field, Tenet illuminates the CIA's painstaking attempts to prepare the country against new and deadly threats, disentangles the interlocking events that led to 9\/11, and offers explosive new information on the deliberations and strategies that culminated in the U.S. invasion of Iraq.     Beginning with his appointment as Director of Central Intelligence in 1997, Tenet unfolds the momentous events that led to 9\/11 as he saw and experienced them: his declaration of war on al-Qa'ida; the CIA's covert operations inside Afghanistan; the worldwide operational plan to fight terrorists; his warnings of imminent attacks against American interests to White House officials in the summer of 2001; and the plan for a coordinated and devastating counterattack against al-Qa'ida laid down just six days after the attacks.     Tenet's compelling narrative then turns to the war in Iraq as he provides dramatic insight and background on the run-up to the invasion, including a firsthand account of the fallout from the inclusion of \"sixteen words\" in the president's 2003 State of the Union address, which claimed that Saddam Hussein had sought to purchase uranium from Africa; the true context of Tenet's own now-famous \"slam dunk\" comment regarding Saddam's WMD program; and the CIA's critical role in an administration predisposed to take the country to war. In doing so, he sets the record straight about CIA operations and shows readers that the truth is more complex than suggested in other versions of recent history offered thus far.     Through it all, Tenet paints an unflinching self-portrait of a man caught between the warring forces of the administration's decision-making process, the reams of frightening intelligence pouring in from around the world, and his own conscience. In  At the Center of the Storm , George Tenet draws on his unmatched experience within the opaque mirrors of intelligence and provides crucial information previously undisclosed to offer a moving, revelatory profile of both a man and a nation in times of crisis.","price":"$ 39.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["J.

Researchers and popular writers alike argue that the symptoms of the disease occur with disproportionate frequency among poets and other writers, a view that has tended to reinforce the stereotype of the mad artist. But, as poet and volume editor Thom Schramm points out, the stereotype persists in part because the existing literature has for the most part neglected the intricacies of individual lives, especially as these are expressed in the poets' own voices. Living in Storms aims to bring nuance and depth to the popular imagination. The collection represents the work of some eighty different poets, including many whose work forms the bedrock of contemporary American poetry. All are individuals whose lives have been touched in some manner by manic-depressive illness. The poems, which variously depict personal struggles with mania and depression, the impact of the disease on friends and family members, and the influence it has exerted on other artists, writers, and composers, are arranged in eight sections, each representing a specific facet of the poets' shared experience. Poet David Wojahn writes in the foreword, \"All the cycles, all the inexplicable euphorias, and all the self-nullifying despairs are here--but so are the brave and tentative recoveries from such states. The accomplishment of these poems is that they express, with dignity and grace, what Coleridge in his 'Dejection' ode called 'the eddying of  the] living soul.' And this is what poems are meant to do.\"","price":"USD 23.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storm, Lance"],"pubdate":"","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"数","title":"数"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7609633.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"576","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7609633.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7609633.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7609633.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4392712\/","id":"4392712","publisher":"","isbn10":"8895604008","isbn13":"9788895604008","title":"The Enigma of Numbers","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4392712","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This eminently readable book explores the symbolic and psychological aspects of numbers.

Pye argues that for a post-theocratic era in which the mise-en-forme of the social domain itself was for the first time at stake, the problem of the aesthetic lay at the very core of the political; it is precisely through its engagement with the question of aesthetic autonomy that early modern works most profoundly explore their relation to matters of law, state, sovereignty, and political subjectivity.\nPye establishes the significance of a “creationist” political aesthetic―at once a discrete historical category and a phenomenon that troubles our familiar forms of historical accounting―and suggests that the fate of such an aesthetic is intimately bound up with the emergence of modern conceptions of the political sphere.\nThe Storm at Sea moves historically from Leonardo da Vinci to Thomas Hobbes; it focuses on Shakespeare and English drama, with chapters on Hamlet, Othello, A Winter’s Tale, and The Tempest, as well as sustained readings of As You Like It, King Lear, Thomas Kyd’s Spanish Tragedy, and Christopher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus. Engaging political thinkers such as Carl Schmitt, Giorgio Agamben, Claude Lefort, and Roberto Esposito, The Storm at Sea will be of interest to political theorists as well as to students of literary and visual theory.","price":"GBP 20.99"}]}

The threat could be far greater than we had ever imagined. In this important new book, award-winning biologist Nathan Wolfe examines the world of viruses and points the way forward, examining how new technologies can be brought to bear in the most remote areas of the world to neutralize these viruses and even harness their power for the good of humanity. Wolfe's research missions to the jungles of Africa and the rain forests of Borneo have earned him the nickname 'the Indiana Jones of virus hunters', and here he takes readers along on his groundbreaking and often dangerous research trips to reveal the surprising origins of the most deadly diseases and to explain the role that viruses have played in human evolution. In \"The Viral Storm\", Wolfe tells the story of how viruses and human beings have evolved side by side through history; how deadly viruses like HIV, swine flu, and bird flu almost wiped us out in the past; and, why modern life has made our species vulnerable to the threat of a global pandemic. His provocative vision of the future will change the way we think about viruses, and may even remove a potential threat to the survival of humanity itself.","price":"GBP 14.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"2015-12","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"学英语","title":"学英语"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"平装","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"107","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/30304882\/","id":"30304882","publisher":"北京语言大学出版社","isbn10":"7561943733","isbn13":"9787561943731","title":"Eye of the Storm暴风眼","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/30304882","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Kelly Doudna"],"pubdate":"2016","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29870467.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29870467.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29870467.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29870467.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/30326908\/","id":"30326908","publisher":"Super Sandcastle","isbn10":"1624039588","isbn13":"9781624039584","title":"Winter storm or Blizzard?","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/30326908","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"罪与恩典","author":["羅絲瑪莉 (Rosemary A.

Los Angeles is gripped by war fever and racial hatred. Sergeant Dudley Smith of the Los Angeles Police Department is now Army Captain Smith and a budding war profiteer. He's shacked up with Claire De Haven in Baja, Mexico, and spends his time sniffing out fifth column elements and hunting down a missing Japanese Naval Attaché. Hideo Ashida is cashing LAPD paychecks and working in the crime lab, but he knows he can't avoid internment forever. Newly arrived Navy Lieutenant Joan Conville winds up in jail accused of vehicular homicide, but Captain William H. Parker squashes the charges and puts her on Ashida's team. Elmer Jackson, who is assigned to the alien squad and to bodyguard Ashida, begins to develop an obsession with Kay Lake, the unconsummated object of Captain Parker's desire. Now, Conville and Ashida become obsessed with finding the identity of a body discovered in a mudslide. It's a murder victim linked to an unsolved gold heist from '31, and they want the gold. And things really heat up when two detectives are found murdered in a notorious dope fiend hang-out.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Heather Amery","Stephen Cartwright"],"pubdate":"2004","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33436187.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s33436187.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s33436187.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33436187.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/34610063\/","id":"34610063","publisher":"Usborne","isbn10":"0746061951","isbn13":"9780746061954","title":"The Snow Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/34610063","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Concepts, Principles and Applications","author":["Shi Cheng","Yuhui Shi"],"pubdate":"2019-6-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33437010.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"299","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s33437010.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s33437010.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33437010.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/34616500\/","id":"34616500","publisher":"Springer","isbn10":"3030150690","isbn13":"9783030150693","title":"Brain Storm Optimization Algorithms","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/34616500","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Brain Storm Optimization (BSO) algorithms are a new kind of swarm intelligence method, which is based on the collective behavior of human beings, i.e., on the brainstorming process. Since the introduction of BSO algorithms in 2011, many studies on them have been conducted. They not only offer an optimization method, but could also be viewed as a framework of optimization techniques. The process employed in the algorithms could be simplified as a framework with two basic operations: the converging operation and the diverging operation. A “good enough” optimum could be obtained through recursive solution divergence and convergence. The resulting optimization algorithm would naturally have the capability of both convergence and divergence.\nThis book is primarily intended for researchers, engineers, and graduate students with an interest in BSO algorithms and their applications. The chapters cover various aspects of BSO algorithms, and collectively provide broad insights into what these algorithms have to offer. The book is ideally suited as a graduate-level textbook, whereby students may be tasked with the study of the rich variants of BSO algorithms that involves a hands-on implementation to demonstrate the utility and applicability of BSO algorithms in solving optimization problems.\n","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Survivor Diaries","author":["Terry Lynn Johnson"],"pubdate":"2018-11-6","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s30457548.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"128","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s30457548.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s30457548.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s30457548.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/31542432\/","id":"31542432","publisher":"","isbn10":"1328529290","isbn13":"9781328529299","title":"Dust Storm!","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/31542432","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Terry Lynn Johnson writes middle grade adventures based on her experiences living in the wilds of northern Ontario, Canada.

Attacks against Americans during the past dozen years may be an indication of more worrisome events to come. U.S. military forces in Japan were attacked in April of 1990 with botulinum toxin by the Aum Shinrikyo cult. Hundreds in Oregon were sickened with Salmonella after an attack in 1984. And small amounts of anthrax resulted in widespread panic and frequent evacuations across the United States in the fall of 2001. Ten experts discuss in detail the threats posed by bio-weapons and assess the current state of U.S. biological defenses.  Chapters highlight the future prospects for biological warfare, bio-weapons in the Middle East, potential agroterrorism, the emerging bio-cruise missile threat, prevalent myths and likely scenarios, as well as the public health response. The promise of future world peace after World War II was quickly shattered by the Cold War. Indeed, the nuclear age was born at a time when the world seemed to be emerging from a dark past into a hopeful future. Are we to repeat history? With the end of the Cold War, does the future hold even greater threats? Or is an old threat merely resurfacing with a new level of lethality? This book should be required reading for anyone interested in national security, as well as concerned citizens who wish to know what form this new enemy may take and what can be done to stop it.","price":"$ 49.66"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sneden, Robert Knox\/ Bryan, Charles F., Jr. (EDT)\/ Kelly, James C.

The publication of the bestselling  Eye of the Storm  in the fall of 2000 first brought his memoir to light, accompanied by a sample of his artwork. In all, however, he crafted some 900 watercolors and sketches. Now, with the 300 watercolors, sketches, maps, and diagrams in  Images from the Storm,  his artistic legacy can be appreciated on its own terms -- an achievement equal in magnitude to his writings, and unsurpassed by any other Civil War soldier-artist.  Images from the Storm  presents the best of Sneden's art throughout his odyssey of combat, capture, imprisonment, and deliverance, a pictorial record of the war that puts the viewer in the shoes of a Union soldier as nothing else can.   Sneden aimed for vivid detail and documentary accuracy in his maps, landscapes, battles, and scenes of camp life. He sketched the camps and surroundings of the Union army, the siege of Yorktown, the battle of Williamsburg, the approach of the army to within sight of the church spires of Richmond, and the tumultuous fighting retreat of the Seven Days' battles as the Union army shrank before a relentless Confederate offensive. He drew dozens of maps and sketched daily life around Washington, D.C., before his capture in autumn 1863.   For the next thirteen months, Sneden was a prisoner of the Confederacy. In a drafty tobacco warehouse in Richmond, he sketched prison life and Confederate scenes before being packed with others aboard cattle cars for a jolting train ride south. In a remote corner of rural Georgia, he survived the outdoor prison at Andersonville and drew some of his most astonishing images of camp life and its suffering. When Andersonville was evacuated, he continued to make secret pencil sketches of Confederate prisons in Savannah and Millen, Georgia, and in Florence and Charleston, South Carolina.   Finally freed in a massive prisoner exchange in Charleston harbor, he returned home to New York at Christmas 1864. He made little use of his architectural training thereafter, but devoted himself to compiling his memoir of the war and converting his pencil sketches into watercolors. A solitary man who never married, Sneden died at an old soldiers' home in Bath, New York, in 1918. His watercolors and his story were forgotten for nearly a century. Images from the Storm reproduces the best of Sneden's art in sharp colors, so we can appreciate fully the mastery of a miniaturist who saw it all, and sketched whenever and wherever he could.","price":"396.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Marscher, Bill\/ Marscher, Fran"],"pubdate":"2004-3","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26572939.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"148","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s26572939.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s26572939.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26572939.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2449797\/","id":"2449797","publisher":"Mercer Univ Pr","isbn10":"0865548676","isbn13":"9780865548671","title":"THE Great Sea Island Storm of 1893","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2449797","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 29.38"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Warren Thompson"],"pubdate":"2007-04-24","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3794911.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"96","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3794911.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3794911.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3794911.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2949475\/","id":"2949475","publisher":"Osprey Publishing","isbn10":"1846031826","isbn13":"9781846031823","title":"F-117 Stealth Fighter Units in Operation Desert Storm (Combat Aircraft)","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2949475","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"During the final years of the 20th century, the most significant break-through in military weaponry was the concept of Stealth technology, and the first mass-produced weapon to utilize this to perfection was the F-117  Nighthawk . \n\nDespite the fact that it was first delivered in 1982, the US Air Force officially denied its existence until 1988. Nevertheless, the operational status of the aircraft still remained a well-guarded secret with nighttime only operations from the Tonopah facility in Nevada.\nHowever, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, thus beginning the Persian Gulf War (1990-1991), the aircraft entered into the public spotlight, flying combat missions over Baghdad.\n\nThe F-117  Nighthawk  flew as a single plane with no escort, and maintained total radio silence to ensure maximum stealth impact. Its success during Operation  Desert Storm , and its extraordinary capability, has guaranteed it the \"tip of the spear\" in terms of American attack capabilities. Furthermore, it was the first weapon to be used during the initial few nights of military operations when the goal was to blind the enemy by destroying command, control, and radar.\n\nIllustrated with stunning color photographs of the F-117 above Iraq, and complemented by numerous personal accounts from the pilots themselves, this book explores the history and combat experience of one of the most secretive planes ever built.","price":"USD 20.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Glantz, David

Wounded severely in both body and spirit, Stromsoe gave up the last thing that held any meaning for him—his job on the police force—and proceeded to hit rock bottom, hard.     That was a lifetime ago, and finally the spiral of personal destruction and despair seems to have come to an end. The man responsible for the murders—Stromsoe's best friend from childhood and his wife's old lover—is behind bars and Stromsoe has put the past behind him, rescued from the abyss by a former colleague who offers him a job at his private security firm. Stromsoe's first assignment is to protect local television personality Frankie Hatfield from a stalker. But the further Stromsoe is drawn into this case, the more he finds that the net of intrigue is wide and ultimately leads back to the man who killed his family. As events conspire against him, Stromsoe learns that prison is no safeguard against revenge.     T. Jefferson Parker has been hailed as belonging \"in the first rank of American crime novelists\" ( Washington Post Book World ) and praised for \"some of the finest writing you'll ever read\" ( Chicago Sun-Times ). Superbly crafted, emotionally complex, and filled with heart-stopping action, Storm Runners proves why the novels of T. Jefferson Parker are impossible to resist.","price":"205.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Fletcher, Meredith"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"297","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2960838\/","id":"2960838","publisher":"Harlequin Books","isbn10":"0373514344","isbn13":"9780373514342","title":"Storm Force","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2960838","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"4.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storm, Ruby"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8306035.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"408","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8306035.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8306035.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8306035.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2962680\/","id":"2962680","publisher":"Elloras Cave Pub Inc","isbn10":"1419954377","isbn13":"9781419954375","title":"Keeper of the Spirit","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2962680","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 21.46"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Gutteridge, Rene"],"pubdate":"2006-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4879287.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"349","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4879287.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4879287.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4879287.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2962909\/","id":"2962909","publisher":"Tyndale House Pub","isbn10":"0842387668","isbn13":"9780842387668","title":"Storm Surge","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2962909","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"After ten years, FBI Agent Mick Kline thought he had put his past behind him.

Unfortunately, she's a Guardian now, and her visions of the future have grown so intense she is literally blind to the world while in their grip. Another complication is her Watcher, Hanson, who is sleeping on her couch and scaring her roommates, when he's not shepherding her through the visions and calming her progressively worsening nightmares. Then the earthquakes start, warning of an even bigger disaster-a disaster that could level her beloved city and claim both Mari's and her best friend's lives. A disaster her visions say are triggered by Hanson, even though he's sworn to protect her. Hanson has his own problems. He joined the Watchers to atone for a life of lies, but it seems the only way he can stay close enough to Mari to protect her is to use some of his less than honest talents. She is the only witch who can ease the agony of being a Watcher, and the only woman in the world he wants, but the distance between them grows daily. Then Mari's house is broken into and her roommates slaughtered by the Dark. In order to save Mari from the evil that hunts her, he's going to have to become more of the Dark himself, more of what frightens her, and risk losing her forever.","price":"$ 15.54"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Onan, Bob"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"337","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2961530\/","id":"2961530","publisher":"Scb Distributors","isbn10":"1880654334","isbn13":"9781880654330","title":"Taming Storm Surges","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2961530","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"131.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Faidley, Warren"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"182","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2510207\/","id":"2510207","publisher":"Independent Pub Group","isbn10":"1888763000","isbn13":"9781888763003","title":"Storm Chaser","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2510207","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"24.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Dunlop, Storm"],"pubdate":"2006-8","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4762086.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"256","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4762086.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4762086.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4762086.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2510520\/","id":"2510520","publisher":"Harpercollins","isbn10":"0060818670","isbn13":"9780060818678","title":"Weather","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2510520","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"For the hidden weatherman in us all        The perfect introduction to what is happening in the sky, come rain or shine       All weather conditions, clouds, and optical phenomena are fully illustrated with color photographs       Practical explanations of how weather is forecast and how to read weather maps Published in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution, America’s foremost authority in history and science.","price":"63.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Murthy, T.

Yet a large international policy framework has been built precisely on the assumption that we know what is happening and how to control it. In Take by Storm, Christopher Essex and Ross McKitrick prove this assumption false, carefully explaining the science of climate change and deconstructing the widespread myth of global warming. They argue that the connection between science and society is disintegrating, and they propose a vital first step toward repairing this relationship. From Chapter 10 of Taken by Storm: It is understandable that people think only a handful of marginal critics have doubts {about global warming}. The critics, when not dismissed as contrarians, are often referred to as skeptics. They have also been called dissidents, bringing to mind internal opponents of the Cold War Soviet Union. Lately, the terms deniers and climate criminals have become more common as the political nastiness has grownWe have shown, page after page, that certainty on the subject of the future direction of climate is impossiblethat anyone who thinks we can predict the climate only courts the laughter of the gods.","price":"USD 19.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Theodor Storm","Joachim Will"],"pubdate":"2001-09-01","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2933646.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s2933646.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s2933646.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2933646.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2996089\/","id":"2996089","publisher":"Klett","isbn10":"3129280928","isbn13":"9783129280928","title":"Lektüre easy, Der Schimmelreiter","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2996089","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Ben Nussbaum"],"pubdate":"2005-4","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5571585.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"36","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5571585.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5571585.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5571585.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2985565\/","id":"2985565","publisher":"","isbn10":"1592494609","isbn13":"9781592494606","title":"Spinosaurus in the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2985565","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Spinosaurus lives where a river meets the shores of an ocean.

Brink's parable suggests that white Europeans have punished native Africans in the same way. With this novel, Brink takes us to the heart of the relationships that define South Africa?smodern history. ?Peter Carey, Garcia Marquez, Solzhenitsyn: Andr?? Brink must be considered with that class of writer.? -Guardian","price":"$ 14.63"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Barton, Bob"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2967365\/","id":"2967365","publisher":"Scb Distributors","isbn10":"1550820605","isbn13":"9781550820607","title":"Storm Wife","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2967365","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"12.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"And Other Short Fiction","author":["Theodor Storm"],"pubdate":"2004-09-05","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3952053.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":["Jackson, Denis"],"catalog":"","pages":"224","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3952053.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3952053.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3952053.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2966054\/","id":"2966054","publisher":"Angel Books","isbn10":"0946162700","isbn13":"9780946162703","title":"Paul the Puppeteer","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2966054","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Here are three contrasting works from Theodor Storm's middle period--the 1870s.

Both these stories are translated into English for the first time. One of Storm's most moving stories, \"Renate,\" records the memories of an eighteenth-century Lutheran pastor and his love for a farmer's daughter who is persecuted by the local community for alleged witchcraft.

With far too little help from indifferent, incompetent government agencies, the poor bore the brunt of the disaster. The residents of traditionally impoverished and minority communities suffered incalculable losses and endured unimaginable conditions. And the few facilities that did exist to help victims quickly became miserable, dangerous places. Now, the victims of Hurricane Katrina find themselves spread across the United States, far from the homes they left and faced with the prospect of starting anew. Families are struggling to secure jobs, homes, schools, and a sense of place in unfamiliar surroundings. Meanwhile, the rebuilding of their former home remains frustrating out of their hands.

With the first edition of The Latin Tinge, John Storm Roberts offered revolutionary insight into the enormous importance of Latin influences in U.S. popular music of all kinds. Now, in this revised second edition, Roberts updates the history of Latin American influences on the American music scene over the last twenty years. From the merengue wave to the great traditions of salsa and nortena music to the fusion styles of Cubop and Latin rock, Roberts provides a comprehensive review. With an update on the jazz scene and the careers of legendary musicians as well as newer bands on the circuit, the second edition of The Latin Tinge sheds new light on a rich and complex subject: the crucial contribution that Latin rhythms are making to our uniquely American idiom.","price":"$ 39.54"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Holly, Emma"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2550587\/","id":"2550587","publisher":"Virgin Pub","isbn10":"0352336862","isbn13":"9780352336866","title":"Cooking Up a Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2550587","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"7.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sydney Croft"],"pubdate":"2007-8-28","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4671682.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"352","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4671682.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4671682.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4671682.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2519794\/","id":"2519794","publisher":"Delta","isbn10":"038534080X","isbn13":"9780385340809","title":"Riding the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2519794","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"A storm’s rage.

Whether tackling danger or wrestling with desire, her elite heroes and heroines never fail to give their all, in stories that soar above and beyond expectations. Now, in her electrifying new novel, Brockmann takes us INTO THE STORM. In a remote, frozen corner of New Hampshire, a Navy SEAL team and the elite security experts of Troubleshooters, Incorporated are going head-to-head as fierce but friendly rivals in a raid-and-rescue training exercise. Despite the frigid winter temperatures, tension smolders between veteran SEAL Petty Officer Mark \"Jenk\" Jenkins and former cop turned Troubleshooter Lindsey Fontaine after an impulsive night goes awry. And then, suddenly, Tracy Shapiro, the Troubleshooters' new receptionist, vanishes while playing the role of hostage during a mock rescue operation. Teaming up with the FBI to launch a manhunt in the treacherous wilderness, Jenk and Lindsey must put aside their feelings as a record snowstorm approaches, dramatically reducing any hope of finding Tracy alive. The trail is colder than the biting New England climate until a lucky break leads to a horrifying discovery-a brutally murdered young woman wearing the jacket Tracy wore when she disappeared. Suddenly there is a chilling certainty that Tracy has fallen prey to a serial killer-one who knows the backwoods terrain and who doesn't play by the rules of engagement. In a race against time, a raging blizzard, and a cunning opponent, Jenk and Lindsey are put to the ultimate test. Rising everything, they must finally come together in a desperate attempt to save Tracy-and each other. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"","price":"$ 9.03"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Stuart, Anne"],"pubdate":"2007-11","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s19270011.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"347","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s19270011.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s19270011.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s19270011.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2539044\/","id":"2539044","publisher":"Harlequin Books","isbn10":"0778325008","isbn13":"9780778325000","title":"Ice Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2539044","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Behind her mask is a deadly secret?

Wounded severely in both body and spirit, Stromsoe gave up the last thing that held any meaning for him—his job on the police force—and proceeded to hit rock bottom, hard.     That was a lifetime ago, and finally the spiral of personal destruction and despair seems to have come to an end. The man responsible for the murders—Stromsoe's best friend from childhood and his wife's old lover—is behind bars and Stromsoe has put the past behind him, rescued from the abyss by a former colleague who offers him a job at his private security firm. Stromsoe's first assignment is to protect local television personality Frankie Hatfield from a stalker. But the further Stromsoe is drawn into this case, the more he finds that the net of intrigue is wide and ultimately leads back to the man who killed his family. As events conspire against him, Stromsoe learns that prison is no safeguard against revenge.     T. Jefferson Parker has been hailed as belonging \"in the first rank of American crime novelists\" ( Washington Post Book World ) and praised for \"some of the finest writing you'll ever read\" ( Chicago Sun-Times ).

As editor of the French post-war journal \"Les Temps Modernes\", Sartre was able to complement his literary and philosophical views with essays devoted to practical ethical and political issues. The post-war era was one of the most fruitful, exciting and daring periods for Sartre's thinking. His published and unpublished works disclose a striking feature of Sartrean existentialism. The commonly-held view is that existentialism champions radical individualism and disparages community, social roles and civic participation. This book challenges this received wisdom, showing that Sartrean existentialism is in fact a deeply social philosophy. T. Storm Heter demonstrates the vitality of Sartre's landmark essays 'What is Literature?' and 'Anti-Semite and Jew', and reveals the importance of the 'Notebooks for an Ethics', a rich and often ignored manuscript containing Sartre's most extensive discussion of ethical and political concepts. Drawing on these sources, Heter argues that Sartrean authenticity is an ethically and politically important virtue. Contrary to popular belief, the virtue of authenticity is not a mere codeword for sincerity and personal acceptance. Authenticity requires interpersonal recognition and group participation. We cannot be authentic in a vacuum, for the very dynamic of authenticity requires that others recognize our authentic identities. This book not only defends Sartrean ethics against charges of formalism, emptiness and extreme subjectivism, but also shows that authenticity is an important civic virtue, relevant to the social and political institutions of the modern world.","price":"$ 158.20"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Macaulay, Kelley\/ Kalman, Bobbie"],"pubdate":"2006-3","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6652048.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6652048.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6652048.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6652048.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2571034\/","id":"2571034","publisher":"Crabtree Pub Co","isbn10":"0778723143","isbn13":"9780778723141","title":"Changing Weather, Storms","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2571034","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This exciting book introduces kids to many kinds of storms.

Indeed, as Joel Silbey argues in A Fierce Political Storm, the battle over Texas marked the crucial moment when partisan differences were transformed into a North-vs-South antagonism, and the momentum towards Civil War leaped into high gear. One of America's renowned political historians, Silbey offers a swiftly paced and compelling narrative of the Texas imbroglio, with an exceptional cast of characters, including John C. Calhoun, John Quincy Adams, James K. Polk, and Martin Van Buren. He shows in particular how the Van Buren bloc of the Democratic Party--the \"Barnburners\"--stood at the heart the annexation controversy. We see how a series of unexpected moves, some planned, some inadvertent, sparked a crisis that intensified and crystallized the North-South divide, which then became, for the first time, a driving force in national affairs. Sectionalism, Silbey shows, had often been intense, but rarely widespread and generally well contained by other forces on the political landscape. But after Texas statehood, the political landscape was transformed into one sculpted by implacable sectional differences. The bitter discord over annexation--with slavery the core issue--was the seed from which America's great crisis of union grew, leading ultimately to Southern secession and Civil War. The Texas controversy released demons that were never again pushed back into the bottle.

She knows that her strong, brave dog can help the people on that steamer, but will bringing him out of hiding risk his life?

early 1850s, Arba Crane, a young Harvard Law School graduate, arrived in St Louis to begin his law career. Working alone late in the evenings, Crane forms a friendship with the office janitor, a slave named Dred Scott. As Scott recounts his life as a slave, Crane realizes that Scott has a legal claim to freedom and persuades him to file a lawsuit.  Crane fights for Scott's rights for years. The case reaches the US Supreme Court before a spellbound country. But the Court's catastrophic decision in Scott v. Sandford holds that slaves are property without rights and that Congress has no power to halt the spread of slavery. While the decision marks the beginning of the path to civil war, it is not the end of Dred Scott's quest for freedom.  Two Men Before the Storm is a work of fiction (with detailed historical endnotes) based on historical events: the profound friendship between a young lawyer and a slave and a fight for justice that fundamentally changed our nation.","price":"$ 16.89"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Davis, Bart"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2635063\/","id":"2635063","publisher":"Pocket Books","isbn10":"0671769057","isbn13":"9780671769055","title":"Voyage of the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2635063","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"5.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Raeanne Thayne"],"pubdate":"2007-6-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4322443.jpg","binding":"Mass Market Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"256","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4322443.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4322443.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4322443.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2633941\/","id":"2633941","publisher":"Harlequin","isbn10":"0373275374","isbn13":"9780373275373","title":"Shelter From The Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2633941","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 4.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Dubois, Brendan"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"278","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2634111\/","id":"2634111","publisher":"St Martins Pr","isbn10":"0312327331","isbn13":"9780312327330","title":"Primary Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2634111","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"23.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Brockmann, Suzanne"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"636","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2632562\/","id":"2632562","publisher":"Ballantine Books","isbn10":"0739326937","isbn13":"9780739326930","title":"Into the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2632562","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"24.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Webster, Elizabeth"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"424","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2633240\/","id":"2633240","publisher":"Ulverscroft Large Print Books","isbn10":"0708943551","isbn13":"9780708943557","title":"The Storm Petrel","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2633240","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"31.99"}]}

powerful hurricane in United States history assaulted the Florida Keys in 1935, the darkest year of the Great Depression. With winds surpassing 200 miles an hour and tidal storm surges topping 20 feet, the \"Storm of the Century\" killed more than 400 people in a two-day span, devastating in particular a community of federally sponsored construction workers building a highway in the Florida Keys - and kicking up a far-reaching political storm of acrimony and controversy in its wake. Told from the alternating viewpoints of storm survivors, federal Works Project Administration employees, government officials, and local business owners, Storm of the Century is an ambitious work of investigative journalism and historical research, panoramic in scope and haunting in its emotional immediacy. Featuring previously undisclosed documents from the original government investigation, noted journalist Willie Drye's vivid account of the storm's rampage is accompanied by fascinating revelations about how federal administrators ignored early hurricane warnings - and why the ensuing disaster very nearly cost Franklin Delano Roosevelt the election of 1936.  Drye's bracing narrative takes us back to the Florida Keys of the 1930s and delivers the first comprehensive explanation of how the economic crises of the Depression and the cruel mandates of political expediency collided full-force with the might of the hurricane itself and ultimately exploded into a national tragedy.","price":"121.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Alexander, Joseph H."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"242","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2440710\/","id":"2440710","publisher":"Naval Inst Pr","isbn10":"1557500320","isbn13":"9781557500328","title":"Storm Landings","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2440710","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"270.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Will Osborne"],"pubdate":"2003-12","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s10519518.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"128","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s10519518.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s10519518.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s10519518.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1923118\/","id":"1923118","publisher":"","isbn10":"0375813586","isbn13":"9780375813580","title":"Twisters and Other Terrible Storms","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1923118","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Book Description \nWhat causes the earth's weather?

In a narrative taut with the fury of the elements, Sebastian Junger takes us deep into the heart of the storm, depicting with vivid detail the courage, terror, and awe that surface in such a gale. Junger illuminates a world of swordfishermen consumed by the dangerous but lucrative trade of offshore fishing--\"a young man's game, a single man's game\"--and gives us a glimpse of their lives in the tough fishing port of Gloucester, Massachusetts; he recreates the last moments of the  Andrea Gail  crew and recounts the daring high-seas rescues that made heroes of some and victims of others; and he weaves together the history of the fishing industry, the science of storms, and the candid accounts of the people whose lives the storm touched.

Nothing is more excruciating or heartwrenching for parents than caring for a child who is critically ill and unlikely to survive. A recent Harvard University study on pediatric end-of-life care has shown that the medical community is failing such children and their families. Indeed, in their effort to be ever-hopeful and cure-oriented in the face of a child's terminal illness, they neglect to advise parents on the basics of emotional support for all family members, pediatric pain medication, and the need for making plans and worst-case preparations.   Based on the National Advanced Illness Coordinated Care program and the stories and advice gleaned from co-author Joanne Hilden's years of work as a pediatric oncologist,  Shelter from the Storm  fills this advice-and-caregiving void. A compassionate road map to what the family may have to face, what they may be asked to decide, and how they might want to involve their child in the decision-making,  Shelter from the Storm  will help parents and caregivers make informed, loving, and protective choices on behalf of their children in the most trying of times.","price":"USD 15.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nancy White"],"pubdate":"2000-2","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4779187.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4779187.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4779187.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4779187.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2070115\/","id":"2070115","publisher":"中图","isbn10":"0439102758","isbn13":"9780439102759","title":"The Magic School Bus Kicks Up A Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2070115","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"在线阅读本书\n\n Book Description \n The Magic School Bus  was a series of children's books intended to teach scientific concepts to children.

Rousmaniere extrapolates from individual accounts of horrifying events at sea to trace a history of human interpretations of the meaning of life and death on the vast deep' - Daniel Finamore, Russell W. Knight, Curator of Maritime Art and History, Peabody, Essex Museum. John Rousmaniere is considered by many to have originated the storm-writing genre with his classic Fastnet, Force 10, which the \"Los Angeles Times\" praised as 'a narrative worthy of the best sea literature.' In \"After the Storm\", his most ambitious work ever, he takes storm stories to a new level of revelation and universality.\"After the Storm\" is the expression of a master storyteller and the ultimate consequence of Rousmaniere's own experience in the Fastnet storm. 'I can testify that storms change lives,' he says in the introduction, 'because one changed mine'. In the book's interrelated stories, he tells of the hopes and choices that put sailors in harm's way, and then takes us into the gales themselves with authoritative knowledge of horrific weather and the split-second decisions that seafarers must make in appalling conditions.He explores the consequences of these disasters for survivors, rescuers, families, communities, and, in some cases, nations. And he shows how storm experiences shape reputations and beliefs, often creating myths springing from the hunger for explanation. The pursuit of these interconnected strands draws the reader deep into our ambivalent relationship with the sea as both 'destroyer and preserver'. The stories include a tragedy that destroyed a prominent Boston family; the Pacific typhoon that stopped America's first war with Germany; the disappearance of the Portland - 'New England's Titanic'; the worst noncombatant disaster in U.S. Navy history; the stormy deaths of a poet (Percy Bysshe Shelley) and a visionary (Margaret Fuller); the gale that redeemed a prophet after nearly destroying him; the storm off Newfoundland that inspired the hymn \"Amazing Grace\"; and two wrenching tales of derelict ships.With all the harrowing twists of the best adventure writing and the shattering impact of a storm at sea, \"After the Storm\" is a moving, provocative exploration of the roots and consequences of sudden tragedy in human affairs. 'If survival storms have indeed become a genre unto themselves, this is the author who invented the genre with Fastnet, Force 10. Now, more than twenty years later, he's reinventing it all over again, showing us stories of survival and loss we thought we knew in a whole new light, finding others we should never have lost and need to learn again' - Charles Doane, senior editor, \"SAIL\" magazine. 'Vivid, wise, and heartfelt. The crowning achievement of one of America's foremost sailing writers' - Nathaniel Philbrick, National Book Award - winning author of \"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex\".'Among writers who sail and sailors who write, John Rousmaniere is unrivaled in his technical expertise, his breadth of thought and feeling, and in his vigour and lucidity as a storyteller. \"After the Storm\" is his best book yet. Because this is Rousmaniere, there are enough finely described high winds and toppling waves here to satisfy the toughest and most fearless armchair adventurers. But the storm at sea is for Rousmaniere only the beginning. His quest for meaning in the chaos of turbulent air and water is conducted on so many fronts that the reader is left breathless and dazzled by this marvellous inquiry' - Jonathan Raban, author of \"Passage to Juneau: A Sea and Its Meanings\" and \"Bad Land: An American Romance\".'No one writes about the violence of the sea better than John Rousmaniere, and he proves it again and again in After the Storm' - Stuart Woods, author of \"Blue Water\", \"Green Skipper\" and \"The Short Forever\". 'As captivating as it is unusual. Rousmaniere's descriptions of hurricanes and shipwrecks are among the best in the literature of the sea, but his book is far more than a sea story' - Philip Caputo, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of \"A Rumour of War\" and \"The Voyage\". 'Dynamic, complex, and relentlessly surprising. As Rousmaniere skilfully observes, the most remarkable thing about an offshore tempest is what it does to the people left in its wake' - Herb McCormick, sailing correspondent, \"New York Times\".","price":"$ 28.19"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Carrier, Jim"],"pubdate":"2000-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s10415566.jpg","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"\n      ","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s10415566.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s10415566.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s10415566.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1695430\/","id":"1695430","publisher":"International Marine\/Ragged Mountain Press","isbn10":"007135526X","isbn13":"9780071355261","title":"Ship and the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1695430","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"\"Utterly compulsive and unputdownable - the most exciting, authentic, and humanly moving of all the recent Storm books.

The last days of the Fantome are reconstructed in vivid and heartbreaking detail through Jim Carrier's extensive research and hundreds of personal interviews.

For the film, composer Mychael Danna created one of the most distinctive scores of the 1990s, one that constantly challenges perceptions of the form and function of film music.  In Mychael Danna's The Ice Storm: A Film Score Guide, Miguel Mera explores the music and sound Danna uses in his score, investigating the narrative, structural, and aesthetic themes of the film and illustrating the techniques and stylistic features central to Danna's music. Mera carefully examines the collaborative processes that influenced the score's development, describing the significance of the composer's relationships with the director, producer, editor, orchestrator, and sound designers to the evolution of the score and demonstrating how the politics of filmmaking interact with creativity. This seventh volume in Scarecrow's Film Score Guide series also includes a biography of Danna and a complete analysis of the full soundtrack considering the sound design, pre-existent pop songs, and the specifically arranged song by David Bowie in conjunction with Danna's fascinating score, making this essential reading for film music scholars and students.","price":"$ 41.81"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Thomas, Geoff"],"pubdate":"2007-9","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s19232575.jpg","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s19232575.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s19232575.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s19232575.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2813238\/","id":"2813238","publisher":"Sterling Pub Co Inc","isbn10":"0752876147","isbn13":"9780752876146","title":"Riding Through The Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2813238","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"When Geoff Thomas struggled to play a friendly game of tennis while on holiday in Mallorca in May 2003, he thought little of it.  Recently retired as a footballer, he believed it was a sign of ageing and perhaps a pulled muscle.  But when the pain wouldn't go away, his wife Julie persuaded him to go to a doctor, and in July he was diagnosed as having leukaemia.  Suddenly, he was fighting to survive. This book focuses on his journey round the Tour de France in the summer of 2005, riding the 2240 mile-course in the 21 days it takes Lance Armstrong and all the top cyclists, despite never having cycled much before.  Despite the odds against him achieving it, he rode the course and raised nearly 200,000 for charity.  As he rides, he looks back on his successful career as a footballer, and the bone marrow transplant that saved his life.  This is a powerful, moving and inspirational story of extraordinary achievement.","price":"$ 28.19"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Dmitriew,

The book catalogues and evaluates this evidence and shows why the initial reaction was driven more by self-interest than fact. This book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the history and science behind the cold fusion controversy.

This new mechanism has important implications for an understanding of many other phenomena.","price":"687.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Justice, Daniel Heath"],"pubdate":"2006-6","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"Indigenous","title":"Indigenous"},{"count":1,"name":"History","title":"History"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s14619796.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"296","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s14619796.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s14619796.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s14619796.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2902368\/","id":"2902368","publisher":"Univ of Minnesota Pr","isbn10":"0816646392","isbn13":"9780816646395","title":"Our Fire Survives the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2902368","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Once the most powerful indigenous nation in the southeastern United States, the Cherokees survive and thrive as a people nearly two centuries after the Trail of Tears and a hundred years after the allotment of Indian Territory. In \"Our Fire Survives the Storm,\" Daniel Heath Justice traces the expression of Cherokee identity in that nation's literary tradition. Through cycles of war and peace, resistance and assimilation, trauma and regeneration, Cherokees have long debated what it means to be Cherokee through protest writings, memoirs, fiction, and retellings of traditional stories. Justice employs the Chickamauga consciousness of resistance and Beloved Path of engagement--theoretical approaches that have emerged out of Cherokee social history--to interpret diverse texts composed in English, a language embraced by many as a tool of both access and defiance. Justice's analysis ultimately locates the Cherokees as a people of many perspectives, many bloods, mingled into a collective sense of nationhood. Just as the oral traditions of the Cherokee people reflect the living realities and concerns of those who share them, Justice concludes, so too is their literary tradition a textual testament to Cherokee endurance and vitality. Daniel Heath Justice is assistant professor of aboriginal literatures at the University of Toronto.","price":"$ 25.43"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Mundle, Rob\/ Rousmaniere, John (INT)"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"249","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2918277\/","id":"2918277","publisher":"McGraw-Hill","isbn10":"0071487700","isbn13":"9780071487702","title":"Fatal Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2918277","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"14.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Pardey, Larry"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8401269.jpg","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"84","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8401269.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8401269.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8401269.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2915445\/","id":"2915445","publisher":"Midpoint Trade Books Inc","isbn10":"1929214103","isbn13":"9781929214105","title":"Storm Tactics DVD","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2915445","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 33.84"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3609931\/","id":"3609931","publisher":"","isbn10":"0689115261","isbn13":"9780689115264","title":"Storms and Son","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3609931","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Hngh Storms is a Buffalo lawyer with an\n ordinary practice: some corporate work, ocea-\n sional criminal stuff, lots of insurance.

Recently retired as a footballer, he believed it was a sign of ageing and perhaps a pulled muscle. But when the pain wouldn't go away, his wife Julie persuaded him to go to a doctor. He was diagnosed as having leukaemia. RIDING THROUGH THE STORM focuses on his journey round the Tour de France in the summer of 2005, riding the 2,240-mile course in the 21 days it takes Lance Armstrong and all the top cyclists, despite never having cycled much before. Despite the odds against him achieving it, he rode the course and raised nearly 200,000 for charity. As he rides, he looks back on his successful career as a footballer, and the bone-marrow transplant that saved his life. This is a powerful, moving and inspirational story of extraordinary achievement.","price":"£ 7.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Brown, Curt"],"pubdate":"2008-11","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s17693762.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"320","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s17693762.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s17693762.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s17693762.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4414531\/","id":"4414531","publisher":"","isbn10":"0760332436","isbn13":"9780760332436","title":"So Terrible a Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4414531","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"It was Thanksgiving 1905 and thirty-one ships were on Lake Superior, making the season's last run. What none of the sailors knew till it was far too late was that they would soon face the worst storm ever to hit the Great Lake, a storm that nearly half of their number would not survive. This is the story of that fateful storm, and of one of the worst shipping disasters in the nation's history.Combining temperatures of -24Centigrade, driving sleet, hail, rain in winds of sixty miles an hour, this terrible storm came from nowhere, with no warning, and battered at Lake Superior and the ships on her: the iron-carrying barge Edenborn, broken it two with the loss of 19 lives in a few moments; the Ira H Owen, driven onto rocks and relentlessly pounded to pieces; the Mataafa, smashed against the wall of the harbor she was trying to enter, driven aground, and torn into three broken segments. Altogether, over twenty commercial ships and smaller boats were destroyed, many of them still preserved at the bottom of the lake, in the worst storm to visit it's wrath in this part of the world. It is a tale of people pitted against the elements, of a disaster so extreme that, in its wake, weather forecasting, navigation, shipbuilding, and compass-reading in light of the Iron Range's magnetism were forever changed.","price":"$ 28.25"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Roger Dean","Martyn Dean"],"pubdate":"2009-06-01","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3794449.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"160","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3794449.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3794449.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3794449.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3746352\/","id":"3746352","publisher":"Collins Design","isbn10":"006171710X","isbn13":"9780061717109","title":"Magnetic Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3746352","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"First published in 1984, \"Magnetic Storm\" followed in the groundbreaking footsteps of the million-selling \"Views\" (1975).

But his mother sees a boy with a heart as open and wide as the ocean.Laurel Lockwood lost her son once through neglect. She's spent the rest of her life determined to make up for her mistakes, and she's succeeded in becoming a committed, protective parent--maybe even overprotective. Still, she loosens her grip just enough to let Andy attend a local church social--a decision that terrifies her when the church is consumed by fire.

On the lost day of March in 1982 a storm swept off the Pacific coast.

How did one storm cause so much damage? And where did it come from? This book explains how big storms are created, and how they travel, with illustrations and simple diagrams of weather patterns.

It was part of the  challenge she faced as she joined an all-male team to conquer North America s highest peak...the mountain the Indians called Denali， or God.Faced the extreme. But nine days into this ascent， a forty-fifth birthday present to herself， the most violent weather on record slammed into the mountain. Ruth Anne and her group would be trapped on an ice shelf at 14，000 feet for the deadliest two weeks in Denali history. Pinned down by blinding snows， unable to help other teams dying around her， and her own feet freezing solid， Ruth Anne tells of a wind chill of minus 150 degrees， deadly hidden crevasses， and being trapped in a place so violent and unforgiving that it threatened to push her over the edge and into a place of no return. And yet， in prose as crystalline as the ice around her， she tells， too， of beauty， courage， and the spirit that drives true mountainers higher， as she risks all to go for the summit...and perhaps， for a transcendant moment， touch heaven.And lived to tell about it.","price":"70.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3635051\/","id":"3635051","publisher":"","isbn10":"0439865107","isbn13":"9780439865104","title":"STORM THIEF   PBK","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3635051","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"79.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3635201\/","id":"3635201","publisher":"","isbn10":"0060854200","isbn13":"9780060854201","title":"STORM RUNNERS","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3635201","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Stromsoe was in high school when he met the boy who would someday murder his wife and son . . .

For decades, stories by Yiddish women writers were available only to those who spoke the \"mother tongue\" of Eastern European Jews. This translation brings some of the \"lost\" women writers of the golden age of Yiddish to English-speaking readers. Their stories range from the wryly humorous-a girl seeking a wet nurse for her cousin brings him to a shiksa, with dire consequences-to the bittersweet, as a once-idealistic revolutionary now sees her hopes for humanity as \"fantasy.\" The title is from a poem that describes a widow arguing with a storm that threatens her harvest. It is a metaphor for the Holocaust, whose dark cloud was rising. Arguing with the Storm is a joy to read and a tribute to all those women, who, in arguing with the storm, fought to protect their families and way of life. The anthology includes works by Sarah Hamer-Jacklyn, Bryna Bercovitch, Anne Viderman, Malka Lee, Frume Halpern, Rochel Bruches, Paula Frankel-Zaltzman, Chava Rosenfarb, and Rikuda Potash.  Rhea Tregebov teaches creative writing at the University of British Columbia and is the author of six critically acclaimed books of poetry, most recently (alive): Poems New and Selected. She collected these tales with the help of the Winnipeg Women's Yiddish Reading Circle.","price":"$ 16.89"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storm, Elliott"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"207","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2701565\/","id":"2701565","publisher":"Booksurge Llc","isbn10":"1419627988","isbn13":"9781419627989","title":"These Scars Are Sacred","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2701565","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"24.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Peterson, Tracie"],"pubdate":"2004-7","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4852530.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"398","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4852530.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4852530.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4852530.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2717010\/","id":"2717010","publisher":"Baker Pub Group","isbn10":"076422770X","isbn13":"9780764227707","title":"The Coming Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2717010","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Heirs of Montana book 2, the sequel to the bestselling Land of My Heart.

Candid and gripping,  At the Center of the Storm  recounts George Tenet's time at the Central Intelligence Agency, a revealing look at the inner workings of the most important intelligence organization in the world during the most challenging times in recent history. With unparalleled access to both the highest echelons of government and raw intelligence from the field, Tenet illuminates the CIA's painstaking attempts to prepare the country against new and deadly threats, disentangles the interlocking events that led to 9\/11, and offers explosive new information on the deliberations and strategies that culminated in the U.S. invasion of Iraq.     Beginning with his appointment as Director of Central Intelligence in 1997, Tenet unfolds the momentous events that led to 9\/11 as he saw and experienced them: his declaration of war on al-Qa'ida; the CIA's covert operations inside Afghanistan; the worldwide operational plan to fight terrorists; his warnings of imminent attacks against American interests to White House officials in the summer of 2001; and the plan for a coordinated and devastating counterattack against al-Qa'ida laid down just six days after the attacks.     Tenet's compelling narrative then turns to the war in Iraq as he provides dramatic insight and background on the run-up to the invasion, including a firsthand account of the fallout from the inclusion of \"sixteen words\" in the president's 2003 State of the Union address, which claimed that Saddam Hussein had sought to purchase uranium from Africa; the true context of Tenet's own now-famous \"slam dunk\" comment regarding Saddam's WMD program; and the CIA's critical role in an administration predisposed to take the country to war. In doing so, he sets the record straight about CIA operations and shows readers that the truth is more complex than suggested in other versions of recent history offered thus far.     Through it all, Tenet paints an unflinching self-portrait of a man caught between the warring forces of the administration's decision-making process, the reams of frightening intelligence pouring in from around the world, and his own conscience. In  At the Center of the Storm , George Tenet draws on his unmatched experience within the opaque mirrors of intelligence and provides crucial information previously undisclosed to offer a moving, revelatory profile of both a man and a nation in times of crisis.","price":"USD 30.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Destroyermen, Book I","author":["Taylor Anderson"],"pubdate":"2009-2","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3578997.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"400","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3578997.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3578997.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3578997.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3449309\/","id":"3449309","publisher":"Roc","isbn10":"0451462378","isbn13":"9780451462374","title":"Into the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3449309","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Pressed into service when World War II breaks out in the Pacific, the US \"Walker\"aa Great War-era destroyerafinds itself retreating from pursuing Japanese battleships.

When a child has experienced sexual abuse, he or she may struggle with low self-esteem and find it difficult to trust others.

This book contains forty compassionate activities kids who have suffered abuse can do to raise their self-esteem, establish boundaries, and identify people they can trust. These simple activities drawn from a variety of therapeutic modalities are best used in combination with counseling to help kids recover from trauma and build confidence. As children work through Finding Sunshine After the Storm, they will learn to deal with painful feelings in positive ways, reach out for support, and feel proud of themselves by taking a bow after important accomplishments. This workbook can help them reclaim the pride, joy, and security they may feel as though they have lost-the sunshine after the storm. \"This book is an incredible resource to help kids heal.\"\n -Deanne Ginns-Gruenberg, owner of The Self Esteem Shop in Royal Oak, MI","price":"$ 28.19"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Paine, Lauran"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7543359.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"221","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7543359.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7543359.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7543359.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4446749\/","id":"4446749","publisher":"","isbn10":"1602852871","isbn13":"9781602852877","title":"Gathering Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4446749","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 33.84"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Jeff Smith"],"pubdate":"2007年09月","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"平装","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"196 页","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3845436\/","id":"3845436","publisher":"HarperCollins Children's Books (2007年9月3日)","isbn10":"0007244789","isbn13":"9780007244782","title":"Eyes of the Storm (平装)","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3845436","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"85.0"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Nicholas"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s25955425.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"0","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s25955425.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s25955425.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s25955425.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4453348\/","id":"4453348","publisher":"Not Avail","isbn10":"849694011X","isbn13":"9788496940116","title":"Noches de tormenta\/ Nights of storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4453348","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"12.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Dietrich von Haeften"],"pubdate":"1997-01-25","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3877717.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"192","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3877717.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3877717.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3877717.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3843315\/","id":"3843315","publisher":"Sheridan House","isbn10":"1574090321","isbn13":"9781574090321","title":"How to Cope with Storms","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3843315","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 19.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Mowll, Joshua"],"pubdate":"2009-5","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4850681.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4850681.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4850681.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4850681.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4452096\/","id":"4452096","publisher":"","isbn10":"076364224X","isbn13":"9780763642242","title":"Operation Storm City","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4452096","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Danger and intrigue follow Becca and Doug into the Desert of Death in the gripping climactic episode of the Guild of Specialists trilogy. \n\nDeep in the Sinkiang Desert in China, forces converge in the race to find Ur-Can — the fabled Storm City.

A self-styled Little Englander by nature, and European by nurture, equally at home, or out of place, in the North Yorkshire moors and seascape of her birth, metropolitan London, rural France, and the capitals of Central Europe, she wrote of country, cities and the exile from both with equal knowledge and sympathy. Out of the changing landscapes of her present, she fashioned her vision of the future. The title of her autobiography, Journey from the North, is a simultaneous evocation and erasure of nostalgia for lost commonality, and in her long life as writer and activist, President of wartime PEN (the association of Poets, Essayist, Novelists) committed to the values of freedom and social justice, she fought to reconcile the conflicting forms of emergent modernity. Her own journey is the generic experience of twentieth-century Britain, and the England she urges on her contemporaries is one that shares the life and mind of Europe. The present book traces the history of that shared experience. It recovers, through her writing, the aspirations and the disappointments of the generation of socialists that was Class 1914. The soldiers returning from the front in 1918, to unemployment and the General Strike of 1926, fight in 1940 alongside Frenchmen, and against Germans, who are victims of the same system: class conflict, nationalist rivalries, imperialist ambition, all for Jameson have the same defining economic horizon. At the end of the odyssey the stark alternatives take shape: Washington or Moscow, the madness of American capitalism, or the oppression of Stalinist Communism. Alongside the narrative of Jameson's life, and the experiences as daughter, wife, and mother that shaped her personality and her career, the book explores her concern with issues of culture and society, cultural memory, and cultural landscapes, her fascination with aesthetic form and the relation of writing to politics, her insight into the materiality of words, and her persistent probing of the nature of the writing subject. It draws on unpublished archive material and brings new research on neglected areas of cultural history into conjunction with literary-critical analyses of Jameson's novels and studies of her journalism and essays. There is an extensive Bibliography of her work.","price":"$ 62.15"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Cressida Cowell"],"pubdate":"2008-10-2","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26642998.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"272","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s26642998.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s26642998.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26642998.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3846819\/","id":"3846819","publisher":"Hodder Children's Books","isbn10":"0340950358","isbn13":"9780340950357","title":"Hiccup Horrendous Haddock 3;How to Ride a Dragon Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3846819","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"77.0"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Drake, Salamanda\/ Marklew, Gilly (ILT)"],"pubdate":"2008-6","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4780424.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"301","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4780424.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4780424.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4780424.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3847201\/","id":"3847201","publisher":"","isbn10":"0439871743","isbn13":"9780439871747","title":"Riding the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3847201","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Cara's so overjoyed to be a dragonrider at last, she doesn't notice Breena's jealousy.

But a condition of her return was that she gave her parole not to fight against the forces of the Republic of Haven until she had been officially exchanged for a Havenite prisoner of war, so she was given a command far away from the war's battle lines.What she didn't realize was that she would find herself on a collision course, not with a hostile government, but with the interstellar syndicate of criminals known as Manpower.

One Sun Storm explores repetition and reiteration as a process of engaging experience, and perceptions at times bleed over into the surreal in their metamorphosis, in images of dogs on their heads or trees turning blue. The world burns with the imagination, yet Hartigan never gives up the desire for, and drive towards, the clearest and most present accounting she can make.

About one hundred miles from New Orleans, it attracted the most prominent members of antebellum Louisiana society. Hundreds of affluent planters and merchants retreated to the island, not just for its pleasures, but also to escape the scourge of yellow fever epidemics that ravaged cities like New Orleans each summer. Then, without warning, on August 10, 1856, a ferocious hurricane swept across the island, killing half of its four hundred inhabitants. The Isle Derniere was left barren, except for a strange forest standing in the surf. Drawing from a rich trove of newspaper articles, letters, diaries, and interviews, Abby Sallenger re-creates the chain of events that led a group of people to seek refuge on an exposed strip of land in the sea. He chronicles the dramatic course of the hurricane itself, as seen through the eyes of a diverse cast of real-life characters, including eighteen-year-old Emma Mille, her French father, a steamboat captain, a pastor, and a slave.  Island in a Storm  is the story of their bravery and cowardice, luck and misfortune, life and death. At the heart of this narrative lies another, equally compelling, story. Sallenger, an oceanographer, traces the insidious link between the environmental deaths across the Mississippi delta and the human deaths that occurred when the storm swept ashore. The result is a fascinating portrait of a coast in perpetual motion and a rising sea that made the Isle Derniere particularly vulnerable to a great hurricane. Ultimately,  Island in a Storm  is a cautionary environmental tale. Global warming is spreading the unique hazards of river deltas to coasts around the world, and the signs of what happened to Isle Derniere may soon be appearing on other islands.

Alec Carrick is an English nobleman who wants to buy them out. Genny Paxton isn't at all what she seems. She dresses like \"Eugene\" and wants to build her own sailing ships without male interference. Alec, a man of great insight, knows exactly what lies beneath those britches. He gets Genny's goat more times than she can count. This is a love story filled with wit, humor, and outrageous circumstance. It's got more unexpected spins than a roulette wheel. Then there's five-year-old Hallie, Alec's daughter, a charmer who will take hold of your heart and never let go. Do enjoy Alec and Genny--and let me know which of the novels in the Night Trilogy you like best.","price":"$ 9.03"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Wick, Lori"],"pubdate":"2004-7","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4834007.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"368","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4834007.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4834007.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4834007.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2719898\/","id":"2719898","publisher":"Harvest House Pub","isbn10":"0736909761","isbn13":"9780736909761","title":"Every Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2719898","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"New from Lori Wick, this stand-alone story shows how unexpected changes can set the perfect course for love. 1945, WWII - When Lieutenant Donovan Riggs experiences trouble with his PT boat, the sailors of Every Storm make an unscheduled stop ...and a surprising discovery.

The Great War has ended at last. No longer must archaeologist Amelia Peabody and her husband, Emerson, the distinguished Egyptologist, fear for the life of their daring son, Ramses, now free from his dangerous wartime obligations to British Intelligence. The advent of a season of joy and peace marks a time of new beginnings in Luxor, with delightful additions to the growing Emerson family and fascinating wonders waiting to be discovered beneath the shifting Egyptian sands. But in the aftermath of conflict, evil still casts a cold shadow over this violence-scarred land. The theft of valuable antiquities from the home of a friend causes great concern in the Emerson household. Ramses's strange encounter with a woman costumed in the veil and gold crown of a goddess only deepens the mystery. And the brutal death of the suspected thief washes the unsettling affair in blood. Amelia's investigation sets her on a terrifying collision course with an adversary more fiendish and formidable than any she has ever encountered. And in her zeal to make things right, the indomitable Amelia may be feeding the flames of a devastating firestorm that threatens the fragile lives of the tender and the innocent.","price":"$ 29.32"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Selbest, Janet\/ Selbst, Leslie"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s20877916.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"157","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s20877916.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s20877916.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s20877916.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2671691\/","id":"2671691","publisher":"Nova Science Pub Inc","isbn10":"1560723157","isbn13":"9781560723158","title":"Surviving the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2671691","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"16.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Lindsey, Johanna"],"pubdate":"2003-3","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3944354.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"336","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3944354.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3944354.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3944354.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2672037\/","id":"2672037","publisher":"Harpercollins","isbn10":"0380896931","isbn13":"9780380896936","title":"Tender is the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2672037","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Headstrong heiress Sharisse Hammond wants no part of the New York society marriage that has been arranged for her.

Like Eigen's other work, Emotional Storm weaves case studies, literary references, and psychoanalytic theory into an integrated, complex understanding.","price":"$ 62.15"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Munro, Alan"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21276815.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"426","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s21276815.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s21276815.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21276815.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2833516\/","id":"2833516","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan","isbn10":"1845111281","isbn13":"9781845111281","title":"Arab Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2833516","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"24.95"}]}

Strauss In The Eye of The Storm: Growing Up Jewish in Germany, 1918-1943, A Memoir is not merely a memoir, or biography, but rather a description of a life embedded in the history of the Jewish community. It is the story of Jewish life, both pre-Nazi Germany and during Nazi Germany. Born in 1913 to a Christian mother and a Jewish father, Strauss was raised in a conservative Jewish fashion, studying Hebrew and Jewish history. Like many other Jews, he took little notice as the anti-Semitism of Nazi culture began to seep into his daily life. He remarks of when he was a boy, how amused he was, when during a school genetics lesson, he was selected as the embodiment of a perfect Aryan. But, as Strauss grew older the story changed. Restrictions placed on Jews became more increasingly harsh and he began to feel apprehensive. Yet, while still a student at the Hochshule, a remarkable Jewish school that the Nazis permitted to function until the early months of 1942, Strauss still refused to believe that things could get much worse, and went on concerning himself with his education in the Humanities. However, by late 1942, after he was shut out of the academic world, made a street cleaner, and then forced into hiding, along with his girlfriend (now wife), Lotte, Strauss finally came to the truth of what was happening. A truth he could hardly believe. Both he and Lotte escaped from the Gestapo, with help from the Jewish underground and Frau Meier, a Catholic, who supplied forged documents so that they could enter Switzerland.","price":"$ 33.90"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Waugh, William L.

Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information， Inc.         From Booklist  The mysteries of married life and the vagaries of one's own family and one's spouse's family are topics Colwin skillfully illuminates in a posthumously published novel. For Jane Louise， even Teddy--her wonderful， new， rock-solid husband--and a baby on the way are not enough to stave off plenty of free-floating anxiety. Luckily， she shares her joy and her distress with best friends Edie and Mokie， who have decided to embark on parenthood at the same time. The extended family formed by these two couples must suffice emotionally for each of the four individuals， since not one of the four fits within his or her own family. Colwin's radiant cast of characters populates a warm and witty story full of perfect moments. This very touching， very contemporary tale of love in the 1990s is certain to be popular.

Herter tells a huge and complex space opera in relatively few  words， allowing the reader to fill in the blanks without sacrificing narrative  integrity. In this age of ever-larger science fiction and fantasy novels， the  effect is breathtaking， an ice cube down the genre's back.  Ceres Storm is the story of Daric， a boy whose entire existence has been  encompassed by a modest compound on Mars with some orange trees， a lake， his  older brother Jonas， and a thinking statue he calls Grandpapa. When Daric is  sent on a mysterious errand to the city， he buys a knowledge drink that connects  him intimately with the starlines between planets and suns and sets him on a  crash course with a startling destiny. For it seems Daric is a clone of the  Leader， a conquering hero of yore who ruled the far reaches of space before a  vast and powerful nanostorm destroyed much of the inner solar system. A powerful  interplanetary cartel， the Kay-Tees， is after Daric's genetic material to  reconquer his former empire.  Herter blends biological and mechanical detail in a compelling fashion to give  the reader a strong sense of distant time. When Daric travels to Earth， he sees  the deadly wonders that the engulfing nanostorm has made:  With each step the castle became clearer; perhaps it was made of  birds， the hundreds winging overhead， flecks of ash caught in clear water，  drifting down toward the castle， darkening the red and gold into a hue called  Tyrian purple， into black etched with silver， the small arches of windows  gleaming like inset jewels， thousands of them ranked up the edifice....   \"See what our infernal machines have done.\"  Like Gene Wolfe， Jack Vance， and others before him， David Herter has imagined a  far future where humanity is both reduced and exalted. Ceres Storm is a  thrilling debut and promises even more amazements to come. --Therese  Littleton         From Publishers Weekly  Although this first novel deals in modern science fiction tropes such as nanotechnology and artificial intelligence， Herter's style and plot are more heavily influenced by the grand scale and breathless high adventure of Golden Age SF. In the far future， young Daric lives a simple life on terraformed Mars， caring for plants and listening to his ancient grandpapa's stories about the amazing exploits of the long-dead Emperor Darius. Then Daric learns that he and his small family are clones of the Emperor Darius; Daric is the most successful of the batch. Unfortunately， an unscrupulous company run by the Krater-Tromon clan wants to exploit Daric's knowledge by using him to open Darius's long-ago sealed complex on Earth. When Kay-Tee agents kidnap him， the boy must marshal his newfound skills and information to escape and prevent them from taking over the solar system. The first half of the novel is an often confusing setup for the second half， in which Daric attempts to outrun his enemies. The boy's youthful， often clueless， point of view leaves out much that's needed to bring the setting and characters to life. The thin backstory doesn't help much either. Despite all the antic chasing-around， there's never enough detail to make the book particularly convincing or compelling. Readers who crave high-tech pyrotechnics and brisk storytelling over thoughtful characterization and context are most likely to enjoy this debut novel.

It takes root, sprouts leaves, and slowly begins to grow. Over many years, the mangrove will provide a home and nourishment for numerous creatures of land and sea. Among its roots come to live fiddler crabs and shrimp; in its branches dwell lizards and hummingbirds. Soon the tree is dropping seeds of its own, and other mangroves are growing, creating a tangle whose benefits extend even to large mammals like dolphins and manatees. There are endpaper maps that indicate where mangroves are located and the names of common animals and plants found in them. Ever threatened by hurricanes and even more by human destruction, the mangroves of our planet are endangered, but in Lynne Cherry's richly illustrated story one such habitat survives, giving readers hope and inspiration for preservation of these ecosystems in the real world.","price":"$ 20.33"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Bundey, Nikki"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8726358.jpg","binding":"LIB","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8726358.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8726358.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8726358.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2755960\/","id":"2755960","publisher":"Lerner Pub Group","isbn10":"157505499X","isbn13":"9781575054995","title":"Storms and People","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2755960","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Through observation and easy scientific experiments, young readers can experience how the various kinds of weather impact the earth.

Reminiscent of old-style Prussian militarists， the clans claim that any man who doesn't join up can expect from them ``about the same reception as an announced homosexual.'' The story is set during the early years of World War II， prior to U.S. involvement. Retired Maj. Gen. Preston Belvale maintains his own private， well-equipped war room. He also has the clout to persuade the army to dispatch observers (who are also members of his family) to report to him personally， and the disjointed story shifts between observers. Thus the reader meets Capt. Keenan Carlisle， who travels with the ``Japs'' in Manchuria until he is ambushed and taken by Chinese Communists who use him as their own emissary. In Europe， Maj. Chad Belvale gets a close look at the ``Krauts'' and their lightning war as he makes his adventure-filled way back toward Dunkirk and evacuation; Belvale then operates out of England. And young Lt. Walton Belvale makes a stand with the last defenders of Warsaw.

When Colton Wescott sees this sign for the Pony Express, he thinks he has the solution to his problems. He's stuck with his ma and two younger sisters on the wrong side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, with no way to get across. They were on a wagon train heading to California when Pa accidentally shot Colton and then galloped away. Ma is sick, and Colton needs money to pay the doctor. He'd make good money as a Pony rider. Colton also needs to get to California -- urgently -- to deliver freedom papers to Ma's sister, a runaway slave. The Pony Express job could get him there. There's a catch, though. Colton may look almost as white as his pa, but he knows from bitter experience what can happen when people find out Ma is black. To be a Pony rider, he'll have to \"pass\" for white. That scares him, and for good reason. If his secret is discovered, he could hang.  Soon Colton is on the ride of his life, racing the dangerous route over the mountains. He's riding for his family, for freedom, and maybe even to help keep a divided America together. As the nation plunges toward civil war, Colton struggles to unite the two parts of his own identity in this gripping, atmospheric adventure.","price":"142.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storms, Biz\/ Bradford, June (ILT)"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6742108.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"40","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6742108.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6742108.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6742108.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2650472\/","id":"2650472","publisher":"Kids Can Press","isbn10":"155074805X","isbn13":"9781550748055","title":"Quilting","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2650472","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"What traditional handicraft allows children to tap into their creativity and imagination?

At times pain is caused by illness (scarlet fever, tuberculosis), at times by man's inhumanity to man (the Holocaust; bodies are recovered from an unspecified explosion). Past and present blur as one speaker is followed through various reincarnations in a single poem. A cow lazily chewing grass insists that \"Prior to this promotion\/ I was the town drunk.\" Her best poems are relentless, soul-searching, surreal and wonderfully inexplicable. But less than half this volume displays vintage Gerstler. At their weakest, her poems are formulaic and contrived, as when she catalogues matriarchal saints for modern times (\"Our lady of organ transplants.\/ Our lady of the power lunch\"). A five-page poem about insect collecting (possibly a \"found\" poem lifted from various manuals) is pointless. Most damaging is her ability to trivialize the same themes she presents so potently elsewhere, as when the speaker of one poem gives instructions on survival to a potentially homeless person. Whether a poem is sympathizing or mocking, the meter and the poet's distanced gaze remain the same, frequently leaving readers uncertain of the poet's intentions.","price":"126.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storms, Biz\/ Bradford, June

boy's fight for survival in nature's most treacherous conditions.  Eleven-year-old Norman Ollestad was a gifted skier. After winning the 1979 Southern California Slalom Skiing Championship, his father chartered a small plane to fly Norman home, so that his son could collect his trophy and train with his team.  Moments later the Cessna, engulfed in a blizzard, crashed into the San Gabriel Mountains and was left suspended at 8,000 feet. Norman's father, his coach and his hero, was dead.  Climbing out of the wreckage, young Norman begins a gruelling descent, thousands of feet down an icy mountain. Blinded by heavy snow and faced with a raging wind and below-freezing temperatures, he attempts to guide his father's injured girlfriend to safety. Kept alive by sheer will, Norman summons everything his father taught him about determination and courage to save his own life.  Powerful, inspiring and utterly compelling, this is a unique and unforgettable memoir.","price":"161.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Carbone,

Cullen's baptism of fire occurs while serving as a young Irish Volunteer and member of the Irish Republican Army during Dublin's 1916 Easter revolt. After his arrest, internment in Wales and release by the British government, he returns home. Quite unexpectedly, Tom becomes a friend and valued colleague of Michael Collins. During Ireland's War for Indepndence (1919-1921), Cullen, a West Wicklow man, embarks upon a life full of danger and intrique. Serving as Collins's Assistant Director of Intelligence, he matches wits with some of Britain's most dangerous spies and ruthless assassins. In his biography of Michael Collins, Irish historian Tim Pat Coogan states, ...Tom Cullen...with [Frank] Thornton and [Liam] Tobin...completed the [Collins's] intelligence team which broke the [Dublin] Castle's spy system. A seasoned vetern by the autumn of 1921, Cullen now one of Collins's closest associates, rises to the rank of major general in Ireland's new army. After Michael's tragic death in 1922, it is Tom Cullen who leads the procession carrying his dear comrade's coffin to its final resting place in Dublin's Glasnevin cemetery. It is the determined accomplishments of this little-known, heroic Irish revolutionary that forms the centre-piece of Cathal Liam's new book. For indeed, Ireland's independence could not have been achieved without the sacrifices of such behind-the-scenes individuals. Tom Cullen's story deserves to be told and now, at last, FEAR NOT THE STORM pays tribute to a life so richly lived.","price":"$ 18.08"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storms, Sam; Taylor, Justin;"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s20262017.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"542","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s20262017.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s20262017.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s20262017.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5940350\/","id":"5940350","publisher":"","isbn10":"1433504928","isbn13":"9781433504921","title":"For the Fame of God's Name","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5940350","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"271.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Ghigna, Charles; Ghigna, Debra; Greenseid, Diane"],"pubdate":"2010-9","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4755403.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4755403.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4755403.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4755403.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5289466\/","id":"5289466","publisher":"Random House Inc","isbn10":"0375861149","isbn13":"9780375861147","title":"Barn Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5289466","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This comical introduction to cause and effect is ideal for emergent readers, who look for cues in simple rhymed text and bright, bold art as they take their first steps toward reading independently.\n\nWhen a twister hits the pond near Farmer Brown’s farm, some very odd things happen.

T. sleeps on a rickety cot in the pantry of his grandmother's boardinghouse, life at the corner of Q1\/2 and 25th Streets is as secure as the sturdy old house itself. But when the hurricane hits, brave and compassionate J. T. is poised to weather and record for all time the greatest storm any American has ever survived.\n Extensive primary-source research forms the backbone of J. T.'s thrilling authentic and richly detailed diary. The historical appendix, complete with photos and map, is invaluable to young readers and teachers alike.","price":"$ 16.89"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Everheart, Chris; Arcana Studio;"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6375401.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"54","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6375401.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6375401.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6375401.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5033459\/","id":"5033459","publisher":"","isbn10":"1434219186","isbn13":"9781434219183","title":"Storm Surge","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5033459","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 28.61"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Yonge, Charlotte M."],"pubdate":"2008-8","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5626197.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"176","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5626197.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5626197.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5626197.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5023524\/","id":"5023524","publisher":"","isbn10":"8132026268","isbn13":"9788132026266","title":"Under the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5023524","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 15.54"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Casey, Kathryn"],"pubdate":"2010-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4746225.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"320","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4746225.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4746225.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4746225.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5033006\/","id":"5033006","publisher":"","isbn10":"0312379528","isbn13":"9780312379520","title":"The Killing Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5033006","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"On a quiet afternoon in the park, four-year-old Joey plays in the sandbox, when a stranger approaches looking for his puppy.

Nearly 3,000 people lost their lives in these atrocities, more than in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. On a smaller scale commuter trains to Madrid were bombed and more recently London. Only in the last outrage were national citizens the terrorists. These were not aggressions by a state, but by individuals believing, by some satanic perversion, that by killing civilians they were doing the work of their God. There was another terrorist attack in the name of nationalism on 28 June 1914 when the Serbian terrorist Gavrilo Princip murdered the heir to the Austrian throne and his wife in a bizarre shooting incident at Sarajevo in Herzogovina, then part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. This atrocity led to the First World War. The 11 September, and subsequent attacks, could have as dire consequences, for the world is threatened by a convergence of six critical cycles. We will call these 'dynamics', for they will have very active and far-reaching effects. The power of any one of these cycles could cause major discontinuities in the life of the West, but in interactive combination they could be devastating. Politics, so long seen as a master of events, is now likely to become perceived as the servant. This book seeks to extrapolate the present trends and then examines historical precedents to formulate predictions. We are optimistic that arising from this convergence of critical cycles, an age is coming which will return us to a greater sense of true values and re-emphasise the individual and the liberation of the human spirit, its ingenuity and creative talent - something not unlike Martin Luther's achievement some 500 years ago.","price":"$ 45.19"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Arends, Brett"],"pubdate":"2009-12","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4790032.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"207","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4790032.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4790032.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4790032.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5309635\/","id":"5309635","publisher":"","isbn10":"0470482680","isbn13":"9780470482681","title":"Storm Proof Your Money","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5309635","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Accessible financial guidance for turbulent economic times With the stock market in a tailspin, real estate market continuing to drop, and the economy in recession, it's important to understand how you can get through these difficult times.

REVIEWERS HAVE CALLED THIS A GRAND WORLD, AN ENORMOUS STAGE, AND A BRAVURA CONCEPT.  \n\n Finally in control of the Ascendancy, Titus Quinn has styled himself Regent of the Entire. But his command is fragile. He rules an empire with a technology beyond human understanding; spies lurk in the ancient Magisterium; the Tarig overlords are hamstrung but still malevolent. Worse, his daughter Sen Ni opposes him for control, believing the Earth and its Rose universe must die to sustain the failing Entire. She is aided by one of the mystical pilots of the River Nigh, the space-time transport system. This navitar, alone among all others, can alter future events. He retires into a crystal chamber in the Nigh to weave reality and pit his enemies against each other.\n\n Taking advantage of these chaotic times, the great foe of the Long War, the Jinda ceb Horat, create a settlement in the Entire. Masters of supreme technology, they maintain a lofty distance from the Entire s struggle. They agree, however, that the Tarig must return to the fiery Heart of their origins. With the banishment immanent, some Tarig lords rebel, fleeing to hound the edges of Quinn's reign.\n\n Meanwhile, Quinn's wife Anzi becomes a hostage and penitent among the Jinda ceb, undergoing alterations that expose their secrets, but may estrange her from her husband. As Quinn moves toward a confrontation with the dark navitar, he learns that the stakes of the conflict go far beyond the Rose versus the Entire--extending to a breathtaking dominance. The navitar commands forces that lie at the heart of the Entire's geo-cosmology, and will use them to alter the calculus of power. As the navitar's plan approaches consummation, Quinn, Sen Ni, and Anzi are swept up in forces that will leave them forever changed.\n\n In this rousing finale to Kenyon's celebrated quartet, Titus Quinn meets an inevitable destiny, forced at last to make the unthinkable choice for or against the dictates of his heart, for or against the beloved land.","price":"$ 29.38"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Mathson, Wendy"],"pubdate":"2009-4","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5556062.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"80","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5556062.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5556062.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5556062.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5906281\/","id":"5906281","publisher":"C & T Publishing","isbn10":"1571205780","isbn13":"9781571205780","title":"A New Light on Storm at Sea Quilts","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5906281","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Discover the amazing creative possibilities of the traditional 'Storm at Sea' block with these innovative new techniques that makes piecing, well, a piece of cake! \"A New Light on Storm at Sea Quilts\" features 6 complete projects, plus an extensive gallery that is sure to inspire quilters everywhere to bring new life to an old favourite.

Maeterlinck, the Belgian poet, dramatist, essayist and Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, whose literary career began with the publication of two volumes of poetry. This volume contains, in the chronological order in which they were produced, all the essays published and all the speeches delivered by M. Maeterlinck since the beginning of the war, upon which, as will be perceived, each one of them has a direct bearing.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911. The main themes in his work are death and the meaning of life. He had written poems and short novels during his studies. In 1889, he became famous overnight after his first play, La Princesse Maleine, had received enthusiastic praise from Octave Mirbeau, the literary critic of Le Figaro (1890). In the following years, he wrote a series of symbolist plays characterized by fatalism and mysticism, most importantly The Intruder (1890), The Blind (1890) and Pllas and Mlisande (1892). With the play Aglavaine et Slysette he began to create characters, especially female characters, more in control of their destinies. After that he published his Douze Chansons (1896), Treasure of the Humble (1896), The Life of the Bee (1901), and Ariadne and Bluebeard (1902). In 1903, Maeterlinck received the Triennial Prize for Dramatic Literature from the Belgian government. His other works include Wisdom and Destiny (1898), and The Wrack of the Storm (1916).","price":"$ 35.88"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Phil Foglio"],"pubdate":"2010-5","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6756270.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6756270.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6756270.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6756270.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6357972\/","id":"6357972","publisher":"","isbn10":"1890856517","isbn13":"9781890856519","title":"Agatha Heterodyne & the Heirs of the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6357972","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 55.31"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Edgar Mittelholzer 1909-2009 Critical Perspectives","author":["Cox, Juanita"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7558388.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"352","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7558388.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7558388.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7558388.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6325164\/","id":"6325164","publisher":"","isbn10":"1845231287","isbn13":"9781845231286","title":"In the Eye of the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6325164","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"255.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Forde, Gertrude"],"pubdate":"2009-11","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5045191.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"312","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5045191.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5045191.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5045191.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5636887\/","id":"5636887","publisher":"","isbn10":"1120613485","isbn13":"9781120613486","title":"Driven Before the Storm V1","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5636887","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 34.97"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["White, Matt"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6381614\/","id":"6381614","publisher":"","isbn10":"142961417X","isbn13":"9781429614177","title":"Storm Chasers D","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6381614","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 8.96"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Jordan, Penny"],"pubdate":"2010-6","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7076308.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7076308.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7076308.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7076308.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6382384\/","id":"6382384","publisher":"","isbn10":"0263216853","isbn13":"9780263216851","title":"The Inward Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6382384","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 31.63"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Graham, Billy;

The storm that trapped the Robertson family took place in America during a period of horse-drawn wagons, trolleys, the new electric light--and the end of the era of the gravity railroad in Carbondale, Pennsylvania. John Roebling, designer of the Brooklyn Bridge, had designed the wire rope for the cable system for this gravity railroad, as well as the suspension canal from Honesdale to the Hudson River, for transporting the coal from Carbondale mines. In addition, at this time lived new prophets: weathermen. Experience this unique time in history through the eyes of the Robertsons. Ride with Mimosa and her sister, Evelyn, in personal conflict, in their horse-drawn wagon along the byways to Grandfather's. The destination is twenty-five miles away from home. Travel the road also with their father, T.C., into the surprise of their lives: the challenge of their faith. This is the harrowing report of what happened.","price":"$ 25.93"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Tha Tribe            Cscany          6351"],"pubdate":"2002-7-31","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Audio Cassette","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7564682\/","id":"7564682","publisher":"CANYON RECORDS","isbn10":"6307122951","isbn13":"9786307122959","title":"Winter Storm Pow-Wow Songs Recorded","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7564682","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 9.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Rosser, W.

This epochal phase of our financial history has been chock full of unimaginable events. The unexpected twists and turns read more like fiction (if only they were) than non-fiction, and the stock market gyrations we experienced rivaled any roller coaster in the world  Riding the Storm Out shines the light on one of the darkest hours in American history and is presented in a lively format that is both educational and illuminating. The story begins with the climactic crash on Wall Street, its impact on Main Street and the real economy, then weaves its way back to where the credit crisis began in early 2007. The collateral damage from the crisis has been extensive, so financial and economic recovery will be a prolonged event. Because of this, Riding the Storm Out examines the substantive issues and challenges Americans will face as a nation of taxpayers, investors, and retiring baby boomers over the course of the next five to ten years and what must be done to secure our future. Riding the Storm Out will serve(s) as an excellent resource for historians and students of American economic history.","price":"$ 27.06"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nappa, Jon Steven"],"pubdate":"2009-12","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7717001.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"270","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7717001.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7717001.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7717001.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7075251\/","id":"7075251","publisher":"","isbn10":"0615323928","isbn13":"9780615323923","title":"Into the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7075251","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 32.71"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Truett, John A."],"pubdate":"1997-8","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7755702.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7755702.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7755702.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7755702.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7089223\/","id":"7089223","publisher":"","isbn10":"0865342660","isbn13":"9780865342668","title":"Monument in the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7089223","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"In 1875, Lieutenant Colonel William R.

Trouble starts when Utah sheep rancher John Robineau moves his sheep herd onto Tincup's graze. In the end Robineau's sheep were killed but no human blood was shed. Mart Joliffe feels badly about the slaughter, even if Tincup was in the right, and feels a sense of guilt over what happened. Yet this is only the first of several ordeals for Mart.

Trouble starts when Utah sheep rancher John Robineau moves his sheep herd onto Tincup's graze. In the end Robineau's sheep were killed but no human blood was shed. Mart Joliffe feels badly about the slaughter, even if Tincup was in the right, and feels a sense of guilt over what happened. Yet this is only the first of several ordeals for Mart. Mart also appears to be unlucky in love, for Rose, the girl he asks to marry him, rejects him and disappears. And Rose's father hates him enough to send a gunfighter after him. Mart is wounded and is nursed back to health by a pretty newcomer, Lucille Roberts. Mart is soon attracted to her and they marry. But the day after they wed, Mart realizes he has entered into a cold, empty union with a woman who has good reason to hate him.

Every living organism on the planet will be killed except a few who might be able to carve out a niche before the nearest star goes mad. But time is running out, the planet's inhabitants are going insane and nothing can stop the onrushing cataclysm. There are only a few who might be saved and only one extraordinary genius up to the impossible task of pulling it off in time. His name is Aaron Seven. From the depths of a spectacular underwater colony, QUANTUM STORMS will capture your imagination as Seven battles impossible odds - a sun gone mad, intense and lethal radiation storms, rogue submarines and a deadly world above that has gone completely insane. The catastrophe unfolded without warning. No one was insane enough to think that anyone or anything could stop the sun from erupting - and so it was all over, for everyone. There could be no second chances; there could be no turning back. In mere days, the closest star would go insane and sterilize the planet, and everything was going to die - everything and everyone. In this first of a series, Aaron Seven makes his literary debut as an improbable hero - called to the Appalachian estate of his former mentor, Dr. Raylond Desmond. But Aaron Seven is not an ordinary man. Years earlier he had developed a theory of quantum stellar behavior that predicted the quantum storms would someday come. Aaron Seven was an extraordinary savant of quantum interactions - he could view them in his mind, formulate the equations and describe the processes in intimate detail. The fate of humanity has been entrusted to this man at the last moment, allhopes rest on this one of binding convictions and the passion to keep them alive against all odds.","price":"$ 22.59"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Twist, Clint"],"pubdate":"1997-6","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6573133.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"48","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6573133.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6573133.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6573133.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6574237\/","id":"6574237","publisher":"Evans Brothers Ltd","isbn10":"023751799X","isbn13":"9780237517991","title":"Hurricanes and Storms","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6574237","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The book is part of a series which studies both natural and man-made disasters, and examines ways of predicting and preventing such disasters and repairing the damage they cause.

Philip Frankel asserts that the armed forces played a far greater role in the end of apartheid than is currently acknowledged in the literature, and that the relatively peaceful negotiations that ended apartheid would not have been possible without the participation of the South African Defense Force and two major liberation armies.   Frankel also examines the topics of military disengagement, civilianization, post-authoritarian political behavior on the part of militaries, and the process of democratic consolidation. He also discusses how many of these themes have been explored in the context of Latin America, and he points out that this is the only book that places these themes within the context of South Africa. This is an important case study with universal implications.","price":"332.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Deforges, Regine"],"pubdate":"1999-5","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6692422.jpg","binding":"","translator":["Lamont, Rosette"],"catalog":"","pages":"96","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6692422.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6692422.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6692422.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6571991\/","id":"6571991","publisher":"","isbn10":"080213632X","isbn13":"9780802136329","title":"A Storm and Other Erotica","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6571991","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The Storm and Other Erotica introduces to American audiences a controversial work of charged eroticism in the great French literary tradition of The Story of O and The Butcher. The Storm is a baroque, surreal novella that charts a beautiful young widow's fevered attempts to hold on to her adored husband. As she becomes increasingly convinced that her husband will soon reawaken to join her, her fantasies become more intense, until reality and fantasy meld into a long dream of hysterical passion. This controversial and intense novella is joined here with selections from Deforges's Perverse Tales, light erotic vignettes that play with taboo and stereotype with delightful results. In \"Old Man's Funeral,\" an old curmudgeon's funeral in the French countryside turns suddenly charged by the arrival of his seductive niece and her young lover. And \"The Truckdriver\" follows a lusty young driver of a big rig through an Italy full of women dreaming of wheels. \"If you are looking for a book that will keep you up at night, you have found it….

In the spring of 1945, Japan’s empire has been pressed slowly back toward its home islands, and the Americans mount a furious assault on the last great stepping-stone to Japan itself—the heavily fortified island of Okinawa. The three-month battle will feature some of the most vicious combat of the entire war, as American troops confront an enemy that would rather be slaughtered than experience the shame of surrender. \n \nWith a narrative dexterity befitting his status as a master storyteller, Shaara relates the story of the struggle for Okinawa through the eyes of combatants on both sides: Private Clay Adams, a young marine whose brother Jesse has already earned his share of glory as a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne in Europe; Admiral Chester Nimitz, who must unite rival army and marine commanders into a cooperative effort; General Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr., the American ground commander trying to live up to the legacy of his father, who led Confederate troops during the Civil War; and General Mitsura Ushijima, the Japanese general in charge of defending the island, who understands what Tokyo will not believe: that his own fight to the death will only delay the inevitable—as the Americans continue their advance toward the home islands and ultimate victory.\n \nWith the fights raging across the Pacific, a different kind of campaign is being waged in extraordinary secrecy: the development of a weapon so powerful, not even the scientists who build it know just what they are about to unleash. Colonel Paul Tibbets, one of the finest bomber pilots in the U.S. Army Air Corps, is selected to lead the mission to drop the horrific new weapon on a Japanese city. As the new president, Harry S Truman, mulls his options, and a Japanese physician named Okiro Hamishita cares for patients at a clinic near the city of Hiroshima, citizens on the home front await the day of reckoning that everyone knows is coming.\n \nA fitting conclusion to one of the most riveting sagas in military fiction,  The Final Storm  illuminates the heroism and sacrifice that defined the war in the Pacific, bringing the conflict to life as only Jeff Shaara can.\n\n\n From the Hardcover edition.","price":"$ 31.64"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"2003-3","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6577855.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6577855.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6577855.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6577855.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6576943\/","id":"6576943","publisher":"","isbn10":"0756920388","isbn13":"9780756920388","title":"The Berry Big Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6576943","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Uh-oh - A huge spring rainstorm hits Strawberryland, and Huckleberry Pie's fort is flooded  There's a big mess to clean up, but Strawberry Shortcake and her friends know that even the hardest jobs are easier to tackle when everyone works together.

The granddaughter of southern sharecroppers who migrated to Seattle in the middle 1940s, Thomas expresses in her art a dual heritage, translating her own vision of southern roots and culture into a northwestern landscape. In her paintings, Thomas incorporates themes of people and their rituals with the land, weaving images around the metaphor of place as both a geographical and spiritual location. Her essay, 'Passing Secrets, ' not only offers a perceptive sketch of the attitudes of black immigrants to the Northwest but also provides a personal insight into her technical and philosophical approach. Because her use of imagery is highly symbolic, \"Storm Watch\" has an appeal that crosses the boundaries of artistic media -- of painting and writing -- and transcends regional locale.","price":"$ 22.54"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Dailey, Janet"],"pubdate":"1975-12","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8046444.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"116","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8046444.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8046444.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8046444.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7079027\/","id":"7079027","publisher":"","isbn10":"0759237999","isbn13":"9780759237995","title":"After the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7079027","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 11.24"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Williams, Sean"],"pubdate":"2009-11","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8046497.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"438","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8046497.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8046497.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8046497.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7079154\/","id":"7079154","publisher":"","isbn10":"0759285292","isbn13":"9780759285293","title":"The Storm Weaver & the Sand","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7079154","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Sal and his friend Shilly have been joined by a third refugee, Skendar, by the time the make their way to the remote island that is the home of the famous, feared Haunted City, home of the Sky Wardens.

Now this forgotten, riveting late masterpiece is available in English for the first time.Centering on three half-sisters, Cape of Storms treats a very specific generation, born in Russia but raised in Paris: a lost generation, having suffered childhood traumas, and now neither really Russian nor truly French. The three sisters -- Dasha, Sonia, and Zai -- share the same father, Tiagin (portrayed by Berberova as an attractive, weak-willed womanizing White Russian). As the specter of war looms, and the sisters enter adulthood, each chooses a different path: Dasha marries and leaves for a bourgeois, expatriate life in colonial Africa; Sonia studies philosophy, becomes obsessed with radical politics, and ends a suicide; Zai, the youngest, an appealing adolescent, flirts with becoming an actress or a poet. It is a shattering book, which opens with an absolutely hair-raising scene of Dasha witnessing her mother's murder at the hands of Bolshevik thugs, and ends as the blitzkrieg sweeps towards Paris. Cape of Storms is unparalleled in Berberova's work for its high drama, its starkness, and many shifts of mood and viewpoint.","price":"194.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Martinez, Andrew J.; Martinez, Candace Storm; Martinez, Andrew J."],"pubdate":"2011-2","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6449186.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"304","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6449186.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6449186.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6449186.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6505561\/","id":"6505561","publisher":"","isbn10":"1881652351","isbn13":"9781881652359","title":"Marine Life of the North Atlantic","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6505561","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 39.55"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Franco, Gina L."],"pubdate":"2004-2","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7746108.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"104","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7746108.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7746108.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7746108.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7086735\/","id":"7086735","publisher":"","isbn10":"0816523290","isbn13":"9780816523290","title":"The Keepsake Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7086735","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 18.02"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storm, Theodor"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8577712.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"112","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8577712.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8577712.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8577712.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7563397\/","id":"7563397","publisher":"","isbn10":"1168357462","isbn13":"9781168357465","title":"Ein Bekenntnis","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7563397","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 18.03"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Medlock, Alicia Griffin"],"pubdate":"2004-8","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7711095.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"220","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7711095.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7711095.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7711095.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7073330\/","id":"7073330","publisher":"","isbn10":"059532049X","isbn13":"9780595320493","title":"Shelter from the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7073330","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"In the aftermath of her life's greatest storm, Laura Michaels must learn to rebuild.

Five years ago, the National Academies prepared Rising Above the Gathering Storm, a book that cautioned: \"Without a renewed effort to bolster the foundations of our competitiveness, we can expect to lose our privileged position.\" Since that time we find ourselves in a country where much has changed--and a great deal has not changed. So where does America stand relative to its position of five years ago when the Gathering Storm book was prepared? The unanimous view of the authors is that our nation's outlook has worsened. The present volume, Rising Above the Gathering Storm, Revisited, explores the tipping point America now faces. Addressing America's competitiveness challenge will require many years if not decades; however, the requisite federal funding of much of that effort is about to terminate. Rising Above the Gathering Storm, Revisited provides a snapshot of the work of the government and the private sector in the past five years, analyzing how the original recommendations have or have not been acted upon, what consequences this may have on future competitiveness, and priorities going forward. In addition, readers will find a series of thought- and discussion-provoking factoids--many of them alarming--about the state of science and innovation in America. Rising Above the Gathering Storm, Revisited is a wake-up call. To reverse the foreboding outlook will require a sustained commitment by both individual citizens and government officials--at all levels. This book, together with the original Gathering Storm volume, provides the roadmap to meet that goal. While this book is essential for policy makers, anyone concerned with the future of innovation, competitiveness, and the standard of living in the United States will find this book an ideal tool for engaging their government representatives, peers, and community about this momentous issue.","price":"$

seemingly impossible existence. As a child, \"Jimmy Pete\" was repeatedly abused by his adoptive father and family acquaintances. He married young, had a daughter, drifted into crime and ultimately killed a banker accidentally in a botched robbery.\n\nJailed for four decades, Taylor didn’t join a gang. Instead, though heterosexual, he adopted a traditionally female role, depending on men for protection and ultimately becoming so comfortable as a woman that he considered changing his sex.\n\nTaylor colors his surprising story with vivid anecdotes, never shying away from the sexual and physical violence endemic to prison. The victim of attacks that left him blind and brain-impaired, he nonetheless finds the spiritual safety valve that filigrees this remarkable book, learning to live by \"bending like the willow.\"","price":"$ 14.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6338630\/","id":"6338630","publisher":"","isbn10":"0884893677","isbn13":"9780884893677","title":"A Promise in the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6338630","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"211.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["D.G.

Four tattered scrapbooks found in a Connecticut bank vault in 1994 have yielded a treasure trove of more than five hundred watercolors and maps that vividly depict America's great national conflict. These scrapbooks, and the accompanying memoir, are the life's work of a long-forgotten Union private and mapmaker named Robert Knox Sneden, who witnessed some of the war's greatest campaigns and spent more than a year in Southern prison camps, including Andersonville.   A must-have for anyone interested in the subject, Robert Knox Sneden's  Eye of the Storm  is a permanent addition to Civil War literature and art, and a lasting achievement in human expression of the horrors of war.","price":"158.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Lamb, Hubert; Lamb, H.

Almost all the storms since about 1700 are reported with meteorological maps and wind strength estimates and measurements. The book also looks at trends and secular variations and the impact of these great storms on seafarers, local populations and the landscape.

She was devoted to the Church of England, and much influenced by John Keble, a near neighbour and one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement. Her novels reflected the values and concerns of Anglo-Catholicism. She began writing in 1848, and published during her long life about 100 works, chiefly novels. Her first commercial success, The Heir of Redclyffe (1854), provided the funding to enable the schooner Southern Cross to be put into service on behalf of George Selwyn. Similar charitable works were done with the profits from later novels. She was also editor, for nearly forty years, of a magazine for young ladies, the Monthly Packet. Among the best known of her works are Heartsease; or, The Brother's Wife (1854), The Daisy Chain; or, Aspirations (1856), A History of Christian Names (1863, revised 1884), A Book of Golden Deeds (1864), The Dove in the Eagle's Nest (1866), Life of John Coleridge Patteson: Missionary Bishop of the Melanesian Islands (1873) and Hannah More (1888).","price":"$ 13.55"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Simon, Arnold"],"pubdate":"2004-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7164626.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"372","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7164626.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7164626.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7164626.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7097737\/","id":"7097737","publisher":"","isbn10":"0974931217","isbn13":"9780974931210","title":"A Break in the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7097737","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"In this suspenseful thriller, Erich, a high-principled young German, seeks revenge for the death of his father in World War I and his mother in its aftermath. Inspired by Hitler's promises of revenge, Erich joins his movement, only later to discover the price he must pay. Brilliant young Lise, who dreams of becoming a scientist, has an affair with Erich. Steeg, Erich's superior, hiding an ugly secret and filled with lust and ambition, seeks by foul means to destroy Erich and make Lise his. A triangle ensues, of love, hatred, treachery, and heroism. Enter Andr?, who witnessed his family's massacre, and Mueller, a world-famous physicist. As the story nears its climax, Lise and Erich both grow, and must make decisions that will change all their lives. The background is the 1936 Rhineland Crisis, when Hitler reoccupied the forbidden Rhineland zone, gambling that the Allies would not react. Amazingly, Hitler's bluff succeeded, and the last chance to avoid World War II was squandered.","price":"$ 16.89"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Macmahon, Henry"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8299706.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"140","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8299706.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8299706.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8299706.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7113154\/","id":"7113154","publisher":"","isbn10":"1409993124","isbn13":"9781409993124","title":"Orphans of the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7113154","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 16.94"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Arundel, Louis"],"pubdate":"2009-12","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8299710.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"176","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8299710.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8299710.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8299710.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7113189\/","id":"7113189","publisher":"","isbn10":"1409993930","isbn13":"9781409993933","title":"Motor Boat Boys Down the Coast; or, Through Storm and Stress to Florida","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7113189","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 19.20"}]}
